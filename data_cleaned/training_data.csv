However it is no good speculating now,and after all our sacrifices were not in vain.  A Russianpublic speaker addressing a committee of workmen againstmaking a premature peace said, they must remember whatthey owed to us how many Gallant English British & Frenchsoldiers lay buried for our sakes in Gallipoli. I have been a good deal on the move of late, have visitedAthens and Corfu amongst other places _ Athens is muchas usual, you would not think there was a blockade on,Affairs are still most unsatisfactory in Greece and so farwe have all been pulling different ways _ I believe they are making an effort now to co-operate better butit seems to me they have got the wrong people out here todo it - At Corfu We had a conference of Admirals to tryand improve the escort & patrol services in theMediterranean, I put forward some proposals whichwere accepted by the Conference, but so far I do notknow how they have been received at home -At ' Salonica', from where I am writing this, we areattacking on the whole front which extends for about 200miles.  The Principal British Attack is between Lake Doiranand the Vardar, as it is an extremely difficult job as it isall very mountainous & our men are not accustomed to hillfighting , so far we have been partially successful, but havelost a good many men, on the Struma, the right flankof which I am supporting with my monitor & blister cruisers,we are holding our own, but the fever season is beginning& I am afraid we shall have a lot of men down with itbefore long - on the other side of the Vardar & round MonistirThe French, Italians, Russians & Serbs & Greeks are continuallyattacking but are making very little head way - Monistiris still being bombarded - I suppose an attack on allpart of some General plan, otherwise I dont see whatGood They are unless the Russians & Romanians aregoing to make a good push when the Thaw sets in.  However like you in France we are killing off Bulgars &Bosches - at the Dardanelles they have mounted someby guns & are trying to bombard me out of the straitsMines are of course being laid every where - after I hadarrived at Corfu they laid a line of mines to catch meon my way back, but fortunately I got wind of these& so came back another way - The Germans sent avery strong bombing squadron out here & they have been doinga lot of damage to the Hospitals & dumps at & round SalonicaAs the army machines were weak & not numerous I gotMilne to let me form a combined ""Army & Navy"" Squadronfighters & bombers and they have been very successful& have broken up the Eurwigs Squadron-I am now collecting up all the Generalist Troops fromall the Aegean Islands, We hope in the course of the nextfew weeks to make the Greek army up to 50 or 60-000Good, bad, & indifferent - We follow your movementsin France very closely and quite hope to see theGermans out of France this Summer- I think it iswonderful the way we turn them out of their trenches& dug outs and I can only hope that our losseswill continue to be small in comparison with those of the Germans - How you must all be lookingforward to the Summer after the dreadfully longcold muddy winter - I Presented some decorations &medals to our French allies yesterday for goodservice during the Dardanelles operation, I suppose it is ourAdmiralties way of doing things but it struck me asrather a long time after the event-I hope you will write to me again when you find timeI am always tremendously interested in all your doingson the Western front",What is this about?,"14- 5- 1917 HMS Lord Nelson, My dear GeneralIt is needless to tell you how pleased I was to get yourletter soon after Anzac day - I often thought of you onthis day itself, and the wonderful way in which yourlads forced their way up their hills and hung on toThem, I often wonder what would have happened if wehad only had a few more Thousand men & had beenable to reach the top of that 900 foot hill from where,if we could have held it, you could have commandedthe Turks line of communication & have spotted us on tothe Forts While they some ships pushed up the straights & attackedthem from inside?

We marched down from the hills, 9,000 feet up in the Himalaya Mountains last October to Rawalpindi, then shortly afterwards out to camp returning just before Xmas.  In February I obtained a furlough and had a fine tour of places of interest, down to Delhi then right across India to Calcutta, had several letters of introduction from brother Freemasons to awfully nice people there and had a most enjoyable time, spent a few days at Agra on the return journey, travelled roughly just over 3,000 miles with several nights in the train.  A few days after returning the regiment was placed under orders to march 83 miles to Noushera on the frontier border, where over 10,000 British and native troops were concentrated, a similar number at Peshawar farther down the frontier, in readiness for threatened trouble with the Afghans, whom German intriguers had been amongst.

"Dear Sir William Birdwood,I thought I would like to let you know privately of a matter which has been brought to my notice confidentially. The New Zealand Government have for a considerabletime felt very strongly regarding the position of thoseofficers, both Imperial and New Zealand, who have been carryingout so efficiently the training of the various Reinforcements. The Government of this Dominion have considered it their dutyto retain the services of these officers in New Zealand inorder that the drafts may reach the highest possible efficiencyin training.  They have also considered most carefully thepossibility of employing officers who have already been abroadand who are no longer fit for active service, but they recognisethat the work would be beyond the capabilities of such menas a great strain is being put upon all engaged in that work. In passing, I may remark that all these officershave been most anxious to go out themselves, and it has beenmost difficult to persuade them to recognise the fact that thework which they are doing here is invaluable to the troops atthe front",What is this about?,"Dear Sir William Birdwood,I thought I would like to let you know privately of a matter which has been brought to my notice confidentially"

"Cases of malingering by troops,October 1914to March 1915.  This extract on the Indian Army Corps comes from a report dated 1 October 1914 to31 March 1915.  It highlights incidentsof malingering and self-mutilation among some of the Indian soldiers which areconsidered significant.  Could this be considered an illustration of dissent among Indian soldiers in the face of the industrial warfare they encountered on the Western Front which was so different from the frontier warfare they were accustomed to? Certainly, evidence shows that between 22 October and 3 November 1914 the rate of hand wounds among Indian soldiers admitted to hospital was 57%, a higher rate than that for white soldiers.  The suspicion was that the wounds were self-inflicted",What is this about?,"Cases of malingering by troops,October 1914to March 1915"

But in the First World War, the increasing availability of the internal combustion engine, armour plate and the continuous track, as well as the problem of trench warfare, combined to facilitate the production of the tank.  The name 'tank' came from British attempts to ensure the secrecy of the new weapons under the guise of water tanks.  During the First World War, Britain began the serious development of the tank.  Ironically, the Royal Navy led the way with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, establishing the Landships Committee in early 1915",What is this about?,The concept of a vehicle to provide troops with both mobile protection and firepower was not a new one

This extract (left) is taken from a series of letters dated 1915 from Sir Walter Lawrence, the Commissioner for the Welfare of Indian Soldiers, addressed to Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War and a Cabinet Minister.  This letter provides an insight into the response of Indian soldiers to trench warfare and how they saw the high casualty rate among Indian soldiers.  It also showsSir Walter Lawrences reaction to this expression of dissent.  In the Sepoys letters there is a constant mention of the fact that the black pepper is being used up and the red pepper is being saved, in other words that the Indian troops are being deliberately sacrificed and the British troops preserved",What is this about?,"Correspondence from Sir Walter Lawrence, 1915"

"Indians enlisted in the army for a number of reasons and not just for regular pay.  Family tradition securing izzat or honour for their regiment, family, clan or caste motivated some to enlist.  The idea of sharm or shame was also an incentive: soldiers felt that disloyalty was shameful when they had eaten the salt of the government.  The idea of shame was also linked to masculinity, as soldiers behaving dishonourably were held to be imperfect males.  One recruit fell over the river and injured his back and on returning it was found his rifle had been left behind",What is this about?,Indians enlisted in the army for a number of reasons and not just for regular pay

"Battle of Amiens The Battle of Amiens (8-11 August 1918) heralded the start of the Hundred Days campaign, a four-month period of Allied success.  After surviving the German Spring Offensives, Allied forces launched a counter-punch of their own and from the summer of 1918 onwards, they were constantly on the advance.  Through the harsh experiences of the past the Allies had developed advanced operational methods that best used the materiel power at their disposal.  The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was at the forefront, combining scientific artillery methods and flexible infantry firepower with the use of tanks and aircraft.

However he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of the orchard, thinking, I suppose, that we would wander about his place!

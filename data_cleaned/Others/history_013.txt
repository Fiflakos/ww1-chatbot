Text: The reason why Britain went to War. 1. To Save Her Good Name. Austria quarrelled with Serbia. Germany made that an excuse to attack France. France is our friend as we could not stand idly by. Germany and Britain had by treaty promised Belgium safety and independence. Germany broke this treaty by making war in Belgium. Belgium asked for our help. Had we refused to help Belgium, our name for honour would have been gone. 2. To Save Her Life and Her Empire. The German emperor wants to wipe out France, strip Britain of Trade and Colonies and trample your rights and liberty into the mud, as he has done to the Belgians. In six months, if you dont wake up, you will be starved into slavery and have to take tamely any insults or ruin the German Emperor puts on you. Millions of determined and unscrupulous German soldiers are in France only 20 miles from England, and any disaster to our Navy may let them come over here. They will give you no quarter and no money. 3. To Save the Freedom of the People in all Europe. In Germany the Emperor rules, the people have no power, there is no free speech. The military class does what it likes. If Germany wins, the progress of the people, the cause of freedom and equal justice and fair play for you will be gone for hundreds of years. If your case is bad now, Germans will make it ten times worse. You have a chance now, but you will have no hope if Germany wins. The Russians are helping us. But remember, Germany is very rich and strong and has made careful plans to crush first France and then Britain and defeat the Russians too. You can take no risks for your wives and childrens sake. Our Colonies have seen at once what this war means. They have few people but are sending large numbers of men, enough to shame us. Life perhaps seems to go on as usual. Do not be deceived, this is the most deadly peril Britain has ever met. You must strain every nerve or you will be crushed under the German boot. FIGHT THEN - FOR YOUR LIFE. FIGHT - FOR YOUR HONOUR. FIGHT - FOR FREEDOM. FIGHT - FOR MANKIND.

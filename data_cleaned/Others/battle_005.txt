Text: BRUSILOV OFFENSIVE The Russian Army had suffered a series of crushing defeats in the first year of the war, but the Brusilov Offensive (4 June - 20 September 1916) would be the most successful Russian offensive and one of the most successful breakthrough operations of theFirst World War("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/first-world-war"). Named after the Russian commanderAleksei Brusilov("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Brusilov")who led it, the offensive used tactics that were to also prove successful on the Western Front. Brusilov used a short, sharp artillery bombardment and shock troops to exploit weak points, helping to return an element of surprise to the attack. The offensive coincided with the British attack on the Somme and was part of the effort to relieve pressure not only on the French at Verdun, but on theWestern Frontas a whole. The Russian attack also drew Austro-Hungarian forces away from the Italian Front and put increased pressure on the already strained and increasingly demoralised Austro-Hungarian Army. Germany was forced to redirect troops to the Eastern Front in support of its ally. This was part of an emerging pattern of Austria-Hungarys growing dependence on Germany, which in turn would create a strain on German resources. The Russians were never able to duplicate Brusilov's success. It was their last major offensive of the war and led to an overall weakening both militarily and politically of both Russia and Austria-Hungary. The war stoked political and social unrest, leading to revolution and eventually the total collapse of the Russian Army.

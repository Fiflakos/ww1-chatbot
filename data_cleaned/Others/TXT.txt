Text: TheBritish Army during the First World Warfought the largest and most costly war in itslong history. Unlike theFrenchandGerman Armies, theBritish Armywas made up exclusively of volunteersas opposed toconscriptsat the beginning of the conflict. Furthermore, the British Army was considerably smaller than its French and German counterparts. Duringthe First World War, there were four distinct British armies. The first comprised approximately 247,000 soldiers of theregular army, over half of whom were posted overseas to garrison theBritish Empire, supported by some 210,000 reserves and a potential 60,000 additional reserves.This component formed the backbone of theBritish Expeditionary Force(BEF), which was formed for service in France and became known as theOld Contemptibles. The second army was provided by the approximately 246,000-strongTerritorial Force, initially allocated to home defence but used to reinforce the BEF after the regular army suffered heavy losses in the opening battles of the war. The third army wasKitchener's Army, which was composed of men who answeredLord Kitchener'scall for volunteers in 19141915 and went into action at theBattle of the Sommein 1916. The fourth army was the reinforcement of existing formations with conscripts after the introduction ofcompulsory servicein January 1916.By the end of 1918, the British Army had reached its maximum strength of 3,820,000 men and could field over 70divisions. The vast majority of the British Army fought in the maintheatre of waron theWestern FrontinFranceandBelgiumagainst theGerman Empire. Some units were engaged in Italy andSalonikaagainstAustria-Hungaryand theBulgarian Army, while other units fought in theMiddle East, Africa andMesopotamiamainly against theOttoman Empireand one battalion fought alongside theJapanese ArmyinChinaduring theSiege of Tsingtao.The war also posed problems for the army commanders, given that, prior to 1914, the largest formation any serving General in the BEF had commanded on operations was a division. The expansion of the British Army saw some officers promoted frombrigadetocorpscommander in less than a year. Army commanders also had to cope with the new tactics and weapons that were developed. With the move from manoeuvre totrench warfare, both the infantry and the artillery had to learn how to work together. During an offensive, and when in defence, they learned how tocombine forcesto defend the front line. Later in the war, when theMachine Gun Corpsand theTank Corpswere added to theorder of battle, they were also included in the new tactical doctrine.The men at the front had to struggle with supply problemsthere was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, many soldiers had to contend with new diseases:trench foot,trench feverandtrench nephritis. When thewar ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375killedandmissing, with another 1,643,469wounded("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_in_action"). The rush to demobilise at the end of the conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 3,820,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920. Organisation. By the First World War, the British military forces (i.e., those raised in British territory, whether in the British Isles or colonies, and also those raised in the Channel Islands, but not theBritish Indian Army, the military forces of theDominions, or those ofBritish protectorates("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_protectorate")) was still a complex of organisations, and not strictly a single force under a single administration. What is connoted by the term"British Army", consequently, is subject to the context, although in its narrowest, official definition it referred only to those military corps which were wholly or partly-funded out of Army Funds by the War Office.[1]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-1")[2]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-2")The British Army during World War I could trace its organisation to the increasing demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of recruitment and theregimentalsystem, which had been defined by theCardwellandChilders Reformsof the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon forEmpirematters and the ensuingcolonial wars.[3]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChandler2003212-3")In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, theSecond Boer War(18991902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration. The 1904Esher Reportrecommended radical reform, such as the creation of an Army Council, a General Staff, the abolition of the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and the creation of aChief of the General Staff.TheHaldane Reformsof 1907 formally created anExpeditionary Forceof sevendivisions(one cavalry, six infantry), reorganised the volunteers into a newTerritorial Forceof fourteencavalrybrigadesand fourteeninfantrydivisions, and changed the oldmilitiainto theSpecial Reserveto reinforce the expeditionary force.[4]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECassidy200678%E2%80%9379-4")At the outbreak of the war in August 1914, the British regular army was a small professional force. It consisted of 247,432 regular troops organised in four regiments ofGuards(Grenadier, with 3Battalions;Coldstream, with 3 Battalions;Scots, with 2 Battalions;Irishwith 1 Battalion),[5]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-MarkC-5")68regiments of the lineand the Rifle Brigade (despite its name, this was an infantry regiment), 31 cavalry regiments, artillery and other support arms.Most of the line infantry regiments had two regular battalions, one of which served at home and provided drafts and replacements to the other which was stationed overseas, while also being prepared to be part of the Expeditionary Force theRoyal Fusiliers,Worcestershire Regiment,Middlesex Regiment,King's Royal Rifle Corpsand theRifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)had four regular battalions, two of which served overseas. Almost half of the regular army (74 of the 157 infantry battalions and 12 of the 31 cavalry regiments), was stationed overseas in garrisons throughout the British Empire. TheRoyal Flying Corpswas part of the British Army until 1918. At the outbreak of the war, it consisted of 84 aircraft.[6]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005504-6")The regular army was supported by theTerritorial Force, which numbered some 246,000 men in September 1913 and, on the outbreak of war, was deployed inhome defence.[7]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeckett2011221-7")[8]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeckett200853-8")In August 1914, there were three forms of reserves. The Army Reserve comprised soldiers who had completed their colour service, and had joined the reserve upon returning to civilian life; it was 145,347 strong.[9]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-9")[10]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004103-10")[11]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESMEBE192230-11")They were paid 3Shillingsand 6pence a week (17.5pence) worth about 70 per week in 2013 terms, and had to attend 12 training days per year. TheSpecial Reservehad another 64,000 men and was a form of part-time soldiering, similar to the Territorial Force.A Special Reservist had an initial six months full-time training and was paid the same as a regular soldier during this period; they had three or four weeks training per year thereafter. TheNational Reservehad some 215,000 men, who were on a register that was maintained by Territorial Force County Associations; these men had military experience, but no other reserve obligation,[6]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005504-6")and only some 60,000 were classified as willing or able to serve an active role at home or abroad.[12]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMitchinson200529-12")[13]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-reserve-13") The regulars and reservesat least on papertotalled a mobilised force of almost 700,000 men, although only 150,000 men were immediately available to be formed into theBritish Expeditionary Force(BEF) that was sent to the continent. This consisted of six infantry divisions and one of cavalry. By contrast, theFrench Armyin 1914 mobilised 1,650,000 troops and 62 infantry divisions, while theGerman Armymobilised 1,850,000 troops and 87 infantry divisions.[14]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAddington198492-14") Britain, therefore, began the war with six regular and fourteen territorial infantry divisions. During the war, a further six regular, 14 Territorial, 36Kitchener's Armyand six other divisions, including theNaval Divisionfrom theRoyal Navy("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy")were formed. In 1914, each British infantry division consisted of three infantry brigades, each of four battalions, with two machine guns per battalion, (24 in the division). They also had three fieldartillerybrigades with fifty-four18-pounder guns, one fieldhowitzerbrigade with eighteen4.5in (110mm) howitzers, one heavy artillery battery with four60-pounder guns, twoengineer("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers")field companies, oneroyal engineer signalscompany, one cavalry squadron, one cyclist company, three field ambulances, fourArmy Service Corpshorse-drawn transport companies and divisional headquarters support detachments[16]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005810-16")[17]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-messenger-17") A British infantry battalion had 4 companies and a machine-gun section (two machine-guns). In August 1914 it included 30 officers and 977 other ranks. It had 25 carts and wagons, including 4field kitchens.[18]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-18")The single cavalry division assigned to the BEF in 1914 consisted of 15 cavalry regiments in five brigades. They were armed with rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with the shorter rangecarbine("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbine"). The cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions, with 2413-pounder gunsorganised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment. When dismounted, the cavalry division was the equivalent of two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than the infantry division. By 1916, there were five cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, serving in France, the1st,2nd,3rddivisions in theCavalry Corpsand the1stand2nd Indian Cavalry Divisionsin theIndian Cavalry Corps, each brigade in the Indian cavalry corps contained a British cavalry regiment.[19]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGudmundssonAnderson200729-19") Over the course of the war, the composition of the infantry division gradually changed, and there was an increased emphasis on providing the infantry divisions withorganic fire support. By 1918, a British division consisted of three infantry brigades, each of three battalions. Each of these battalions had 36Lewis machine guns, making a total of 324 such weapons in the division. Additionally, there was a divisional machine gun battalion, equipped with 64Vickers machine gunsin four companies of 16 guns. Each brigade in the division also had a mortar battery with eightStokes Mortars.[6]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005504-6") The artillery also changed the composition of its batteries. At the start of the war, there were three batteries with six guns per brigade; they then moved to four batteries with four guns per brigade, and finally in 1917, to four batteries with six guns per brigade to economise on battery commanders.[17]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-messenger-17")In this way, the army would change drastically over the course of the war, reacting to the various developments, from the mobile war fought in the opening weeks to the static trench warfare of 1916 and 1917. The cavalry of the BEF represented 9.28% of the army; by July 1918, it would only represent 1.65%. The infantry would decrease from 64.64% in 1914 to 51.25% of the army in 1918, while the Royal Engineers would increase from 5.91% to 11.24% in 1918. British Expeditionary Force. Under the terms of theEntente Cordiale, the British Army's role in a European war was to embark soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which consisted of six infantry divisions and five cavalry brigades that were arranged into twoArmy corps:I Corps, under the command ofDouglas Haig, andII Corps, under the command ofHorace Smith-Dorrien. At the outset of the conflict, theBritish Indian Armywas called upon for assistance; in August 1914, 20 percent of the 9,610 British officers initially sent to France were from the Indian army, while 16 percent of the 76,450other rankscame from the British Indian Army. By the end of 1914 (after the battles ofMons,Le Cateau,the AisneandYpres("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Ypres")), the old regular British Army had been virtually wiped out; although it managed to stop the German advance. In October 1914, the7th Divisionarrived in France, forming the basis of theBritish III Corps; the cavalry had grown into its own corps of three divisions. By December 1914, the BEF had expanded, fielding five army corps divided between theFirstand theSecond Armies. As the Regular Army's strength declined, the numbers were made up first by the Territorial Force, then by the volunteers ofField Marshal Kitchener'sNew Army. By the end of August 1914, he had raised six new divisions; by March 1915, the number of divisions had increased to 29. The Territorial Force was also expanded, raising second and third battalions and forming eight new divisions, which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions.TheThird Armywas formed in July 1915 and with the influx of troops from Kitchener's volunteers and further reorganisation, theFourth Armyand theReserve Army, which became theFifth Army("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_5th_Army")were formed in 1916. Recruitment and conscription. In August 1914, 300,000 men had signed up to fight, and another 450,000 had joined-up by the end of September.[22]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChandler200111-22")A prominent feature of the early months of volunteering was the formation ofPals battalions.[23]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-23")These were men who had lived and worked together, and who as an incentive to recruitment were allowed to train together and serve in the same units. The policy ensured that, when the Pals battalions suffered casualties, whole communities back in Britain were to suffer disproportionate losses. With the introduction of conscription in January 1916, no further Pals battalions were raised.[6]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005504-6") Conscriptionfor single men was introduced in January 1916.[24]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-:2-24")TheMilitary Service Act 1916specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service in the army, unless they were married (or widowed with children), or served in one of a number ofreserved occupations, which were usually industrial but which also included clergymen and teachers. This legislation did not apply to Ireland, despite its then status as part of the United Kingdom (but seeConscription Crisis of 1918). Conscription was extended to married men in May 1916.[24]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-:2-24")By January 1916, when conscription was introduced, 2.6 million men had volunteered for service, a further 2.3 million were conscripted before the end of the war; by the end of 1918, the army had reached its peak strength of four million men.[6]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005504-6") Analysis of death records from the Hundred Days (August - November 1918) suggests that around 60% of those who died were conscripts (many of the men "combed out" from rear echelon jobs and posted to the front lines in 1917-18 had volunteered earlier in the war), and that despite the recent lowering of the age limit for service on the Western Front from nineteen to eighteen-and-a-half, the average age of the dead was still in the mid-twenties. Alison Hine comments that although incompleteness of records makes it hard to say whether these dead men were a representative sample of the BEF as a whole, assertions that the late-war BEF consisted largely of conscripted "boys" should therefore be treated with caution. Furthermore, although there were certainly many cases of men being sent to regiments from parts of the country other than their own, many battalions were still filled with men from their traditional local areas, the same as earlier in the war. Caution therefore should be employed before accepting claims that there was a deliberate attempt to "destroy the Regiment and nationalise the Army"[25]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHine2018298-25") Women also volunteered and served in a non-combatant role; by the end of the war, 80,000 had enlisted.[26]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-26")They mostly served as nurses in theQueen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service(QAIMNS), theFirst Aid Nursing Yeomanry(FANY), theVoluntary Aid Detachment(VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when theWomen's Army Auxiliary Corps(WAAC), was founded.[27]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-waac-27")The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on the Home Front, but around 9,000 served in France. Commanders. In 1914, no serving British officer of theBritish Expeditionary Force(BEF) had controlled a formation larger than a division on active operations. The first Commander in Chief of the BEF appointed in August 1914 wasField MarshalJohn French.His last active command had been the cavalry division in the Second Boer War. The commander of theBritish I Corpsin 1914 wasDouglas Haig("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Haig,_1st_Earl_Haig"). French had remarked in 1912 that Haig would be better suited to a position on the staff than a field command. Like French, Haig was a cavalryman His last active command had been during the Second Boer War, first as a senior staff officer in the cavalry division, then commanding a brigade-sized group of columns. The first commander of theBritish II Corpswas Lieutenant GeneralJames Grierson, a noted tactician who died of a heart attack soon after arriving in France. French wished to appoint Lieutenant GeneralHerbert Plumerin his place, but against French's wishes, Kitchener instead appointed Lieutenant GeneralHorace Smith-Dorrien, who had begun his military career in theZulu Warin 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive thebattle of Isandlwana. He had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during theSudan Campaign("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan_Campaign")and the Second Boer War. After the Second Boer War, he was responsible for a number of reforms, notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for the cavalry. This was met with hostility by French (as a cavalryman). By 1914, French's dislike for Smith-Dorrien was well known within the army.[28]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGardner20031,_10%E2%80%9311,_13%E2%80%9314-28")[29]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts20051096-29")[30]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiddell_Hart193033-30")[31]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPearceStewart2002289%E2%80%93290-31")After the failed offensive at theBattle of Loosin 1915, French was replaced as commander of the BEF by Haig, who remained in command for the rest of the war. He became most famous for his role as its commander during thebattle of the Somme, thebattle of Passchendaele, and theHundred Days Offensive, the series of victories leading to the German surrender in 1918.[32]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffithsGriess200369-32")Haig was succeeded in command of theFirst Armyby GeneralCharles Carmichael Monro, who in turn was succeeded by GeneralHenry Hornein September 1916, the only officer with an artillery background to command a British army during the war.[33]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlaxland196814-33") General Plumer was eventually appointed to command II Corps in December 1914, and succeeded Smith-Dorrien in command of theSecond Armyin 1915. He had commanded a mounted infantry detachment in the Second Boer war, where he started to build his reputation. He held command of the Ypres salient for three years and gained an overwhelming victory over the German Army at thebattle of Messines("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Messines_(1917)")in 1917. Plumer is generally recognised as one of the most effective of the senior British commanders on the Western Front. In 1914, GeneralEdmund Allenbywas commander of the Cavalry Division and later the Cavalry Corps in the BEF. His leadership was noted during theretreat from Monsand thefirst battle of Ypres.[35]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPage200313-35")[36]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlsonShadle199630-36")[37]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnstone2005203-37")After commanding an infantry corps, he was appointed to command theThird Armyon the western front. He had previously served in the Zulu War, the Sudan campaign, and the Second Boer war. In 1917, he was given command of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force, where he oversaw the conquest ofPalestineandSyriain 1917 and 1918.[38]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJones1996480-38")Allenby replacedArchibald Murray, who had been the Chief of Staff of the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1914.[30]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiddell_Hart193033-30")Allenby was replaced as Third Army commander by GeneralJulian Byng, who began the war as commander of the3rd Cavalry Division. After performing well during the First Battle of Ypres, he succeeded Allenby in command of the Cavalry Corps. He was sent to theDardanellesin August 1915, to command theBritish IX Corps. He planned the highly successful evacuation of 105,000 Allied troops and the majority of the equipment of theMediterranean Expeditionary Force("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Expeditionary_Force")(MEF). The withdrawal was successfully completed in January 1916, without the loss of a single man. [39]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-pbg-39")Byng had already returned to the western front, where he was given command of theCanadian Corps. His most notable battle was theBattle of Vimy Ridgein April 1917, which was carried out by the Canadian Corps with British support.[39]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-pbg-39")GeneralHenry Rawlinsonserved on Kitchener's staff during the advance onOmdurman, in 1898, and served with distinction in the Second Boer War, where he earned a reputation as one of the most able British commanders. Rawlinson took command of theBritish IV Corpsin 1914 and then command of theFourth Armyin 1916, as the plans for the Allied offensive on theSommewere being developed. During the war, Rawlinson was noted for his willingness to use innovativetactics, which he employed during thebattle of Amiens, where he combined attacks by tanks with artillery.[40]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeeganWheatcroft1996148-40")[41]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETucker2001166-41") GeneralHubert Goughcommanded a mounted infantry regiment with distinction during therelief of Ladysmith, but his command was destroyed while attacking a larger Boer force in 1901. When he joined the BEF, he was in command of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, and was promoted from a brigade to a corps command in less than a year. He was given command of the2nd Cavalry Divisionin September 1914, the7th Divisionin April 1915, and the British I Corps in July 1915. He commanded I Corps during thebattle of Loos("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Loos"). In May 1916, he was appointed commander of the Fifth Army, which suffered heavy losses at the battle of Passchendaele. The collapse of the Fifth Army was widely viewed as the reason for the German breakthrough in theSpring Offensive, and Gough was dismissed as its commander in March 1918, being succeeded by GeneralWilliam Birdwoodfor the last months of the war. Birdwood had previously commanded theAustralian Corps, an appointment requiring a combination of tact and tactical flair.[42]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETucker2001799-42")[43]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005800-43")[44]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlaxland1968143-44")On theMacedonian front, GeneralGeorge Milnecommanded theBritish Salonika Army,[45]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeathcote1999210-45")and GeneralIan Hamiltoncommanded the ill-fated MEF during theGallipoli Campaign.[46]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-46")He had previously seen service in theFirst Boer War, the Sudan campaign, and the Second Boer War.[47]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWrigley2002204-47") Back in Britain,Chief of the Imperial General Staff(CIGS), effectively the professional head of the British Army, was GeneralJames Murray, who retained that post during the early years of the war. He was replaced as CIGS for a brief period in late 1915 byArchibald Murraythen, at the end of 1915 by GeneralWilliam Robertson. A strong supporter of Haig, Robertson was replaced in 1918, by GeneralHenry Hughes Wilson("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Henry_Wilson,_1st_Baronet"). Officer Selection. In August 1914, there were 28,060 officers in the British Army, of which 12,738 were regular officers, the rest were in the reserves. The number of officers in the army had increased to 164,255 by November 1918. These were survivors among the 247,061 officers who had been granted a commission during the war. Most pre-war officers came from families with military connections, thegentryor thepeerage; apublic school("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(UK)")education was almost essential. In 1913, about 2% of regular officers had been promoted from the ranks. The officer corps, during the war, consisted of regular officers from the peacetime army, officers who had been granted permanent commissions during the war, officers who had been granted temporary commissions for the duration of the war, territorial army officers commissioned during peacetime, officers commissioned from the ranks of the pre-war regular and territorial army and temporary officers commissioned from the ranks for the duration of the war alone. In September 1914, Lord Kitchener announced that he was looking for volunteers and regular NCOs to provide officers for the expanding army. Most of the volunteers came from the middle class, with the largest group from commercial and clerical occupations (27%), followed by teachers and students (18%) and professional men (15%). In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving in the ranks had been members of a university or public schoolOfficers' Training Corps(OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who did not apply were also commissioned. Direct commissioning largely ceased early in 1916, from then most new officers had served in the ranks first, even if in a unit of potential officers.[51]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004580-51")[52]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESheffield20002%E2%80%934,_29,_31,_37%E2%80%9338-52") Once a candidate was selected as an officer, promotion could be rapid. A. S. Smeltzer was commissioned as asecond lieutenantin 1915, after serving in the Regular Army for 15 years. He rose in rank, and by the spring of 1917 had been promoted tolieutenant coloneland was commanding officer of the 6th Battalion,The Buffs(Royal East Kent Regiment). Along with rapid promotion, the war also noticeably lowered the age of battalion commanding officers. In 1914, they were aged over 50, while the average age for a battalion commanding officer in the BEF between 1917 and 1918 was 28.[53]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEConnelly200621%E2%80%9322-53")By this stage, it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions.[54]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlaxland19687-54")This trend was reflected amongst the junior officers.Anthony Edenwas theAdjutantof a battalion when aged 18, and served as thebrigade majorin the198th Brigadewhile still only aged 20.[55]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTERobbins2005432-55") The war also provided opportunities for advancement onto the General Staff, especially in the early days, when many former senior officers were recalled from retirement. Some of these were found wanting, due to their advanced age, their unwillingness to serve, or a lack of competence and fitness; most were sent back into retirement before the first year of the war was over, leaving a gap that had to be filled by lower-ranking officers.[39]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-pbg-39")Criticism of the quality of staff work in theCrimean Warand theSecond Boer Warhad led to sweeping changes under Haldane. TheStaff College, Camberleywas greatly expanded and Lord Kitchener established another one, theStaff College at Quetta("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_College_at_Quetta")for Indian Army officers in 1904. Nonetheless, when war broke out in August 1914, there were barely enough graduates to staff the BEF. Four-month-long staff courses were introduced, and filled with regimental officers who, upon completing their training, were posted to various headquarters. As a result, staff work was again poor, until training and experience slowly remedied the situation. In 1918, staff officers who had been trained exclusively for static trench warfare were forced to adapt to the demands of semi-open warfare. During the course of the war, 78 British andDominionofficers of the rank ofbrigadier-general("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier-general")and above were killed or died during active service, while another 146 were wounded, gassed, or captured. Doctrine. British official historian BrigadierJames Edward Edmonds, in 1925, recorded that "The British Army of 1914 was the best trained, best equipped and best organized British Army ever sent to war".[58]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-58")This was in part due to theHaldane reforms("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldane_reforms"), and the Army itself recognising the need for change and training. Training began with individual training in winter, followed by squadron, company or battery training in spring; regimental, battalion and brigade training in summer; and division or inter-divisional exercises and army manoeuvres in late summer and autumn. The common doctrine of headquarters at all levels was outlined in theField Service Pocket Book, which Haig had introduced while serving as Director of Staff Studies at the War Office in 1906. The Second Boer War had alerted the army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range,magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing andfrontal attacks, there was a greater emphasis on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.[59]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeckettSimpson198547-59") The cavalry practised reconnaissance and fighting dismounted more regularly, and in January 1910, the decision was made at the General Staff Conference that dismounted cavalry should be taught infantry tactics in attack and defence. They were the only cavalry from a major European power trained for both the mounted cavalry charge and dismounted action, and equipped with the same rifles as the infantry, rather than short-rangecarbines.The cavalry were also issued withentrenching toolsprior to the outbreak of war, as a result of experience gained during the Second Boer War.[60]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBadsey2008227-60")[61]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBadsey2008198-61") The infantry's marksmanship, and fire and movement techniques, had been inspired by Boer tactics and was established as formal doctrine by ColonelCharles Monrowhen he was in charge of the School of Musketry atHythe("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hythe_Army_Camp&action=edit&redlink=1"). In 1914, British rifle fire was so effective that there were some reports to the effect that the Germans believed they were facing huge numbers of machine guns. The Army concentrated on rifle practice, with days spent on the ranges dedicated to improving marksmanship and obtaining a rate of fire of 15 effective rounds a minute at 300yd (270m); one sergeant set a record of 38 rounds into a 12in (300mm) target set at 300yd (270m) in 30 seconds. In their 1914 skill-at-arms meeting, the 1st BattalionBlack Watchrecorded 184 marksmen, 263 first-class shots, 89-second-class shots and four third-class shots, at ranges from 300600yd (270550m). The infantry also practised squad and section attacks and fire from cover, often without orders from officers orNCOs("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer"), so that soldiers would be able to act on their own initiative. In the last exercise before the war, it was noted that the "infantry made wonderful use of ground, advances in short rushes and always at the double and almost invariably fires from a prone position". Weapons. The British Army was armed with theShort Magazine LeeEnfield Mk III(SMLE Mk III), which featured a bolt-action and largemagazinecapacity that enabled a trained rifleman to fire 2030 aimed rounds a minute. First World War accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers, who subsequently reported that they had encountered machine guns, when in fact, it was simply a group of trained riflemen armed with SMLEs. The heavyVickers machine gunproved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield, with some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology. One account tells of the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps atHigh Wood("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Wood")on 24 August 1916. This company had 10 Vickers guns; it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area 2,000yd (1,800m) away, to prevent German troops forming up there for a counterattack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantry were allocated as ammunition, rations and water carriers for the gunners. Two men worked a beltfilling machine nonstop for 12 hours, keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. They used 100 new barrels and all of the waterincluding the men's drinking water and the contents of thelatrine("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrine")bucketsto keep the guns cool. In that 12-hour period, the 10 guns fired just short of one million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000. At the close of the operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one had broken down during the whole period. The lighterLewis gunwas adopted for land and aircraft use in October 1915. The Lewis gun had the advantage of being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, and far more portable. By the end of the First World War, over 50,000 Lewis Guns had been produced; they were nearly ubiquitous on the Western Front, outnumbering the Vickers gun by a ratio of about 3:1.[65]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFord200571-65")[66]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESkennerton19886,_159-66")[67]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHogg197127,_62-67") The British used improvised mortars as a stop-gap, with the2-inch medium mortarand its "toffee apple" projectile being deployed from March 1915.[68]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002134-68")This was superseded by the 81mmStokes Mortar, first issued at the end of 1915[69]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-69")which was later adopted by the French Army too. Finally, theMark I tank("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_(tank)")a British inventionwas seen as the solution to the stalemate of trench warfare. The Mark I had a range of 23mi (37km) without refuelling, and a speed of 3mph (4.8km/h); it first saw service on the Somme in September 1916. Infantry Tactics. After the "race to the sea",manoeuvre warfaregave way totrench warfare, a development for which the British Army had not prepared. Expecting an offensive mobile war, the Army had not instructed the troops in defensive tactics and had failed to obtain stocks ofbarbed wire,hand grenades, ortrench mortars.[71]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffithsGriess200363-71")In the early years of trench warfare, the normal infantry attack formation was based on the battalion, which comprised fourcompaniesthat were each made up of fourplatoons. The battalion would form 10 waves with 100yd (91m) between each, while each company formed two waves of two platoons. The first six waves were the fighting elements from three of the battalions' companies, the seventh contained the battalion headquarters; the remaining company formed the eighth and ninth waves, which were expected to carry equipment forward, the tenth wave contained the stretcher bearers and medics.The formation was expected to move forward at a rate of 100yd (91m) every two minutes, even though each man carried his rifle,bayonet, gas mask, ammunition, twohand grenades,wire cutters, a spade, two emptysandbagsandflares. The carrying platoons, in addition to the above, also carried extra ammunition, barbed wire and construction materials to effect repairs to captured lines and fortifications.[72]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerMatysek_WoodMurphy1996357-72")By 1918, experience had led to a change in tactics; the infantry no longer advanced in rigid lines, but formed a series of flexible waves. They would move covertly, under the cover of darkness, and occupy shell holes or other cover near the German line.Skirmishersformed the first wave and followed the creeping barrage into the German front line to hunt out points of resistance. The second or main wave followed in platoons or sections in single file. The third was formed from small groups of reinforcements, the fourth wave was expected to defend the captured territory. All waves were expected to take advantage of the ground during the advance. (see below for when operating with tanks)Each platoon now had a Lewis gun section and a section that specialised in throwing hand-grenades (then known as bombs), each section was compelled to provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties. Each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in the attack they were to advance, without halting; butleap froggingwas accepted, with the lead platoon taking an objective and the following platoons passing through them and onto the next objective, while the Lewis gunners provided fire support.Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.[73]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBull200249%E2%80%9351-73") Tank tactics[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=10")] The tank was designed to break the deadlock of trench warfare.[74]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-bbctank-74")In their first use on the Somme, they were placed under command of the infantry and ordered to attack their given targets in groups or pairs. They were also assigned small groups of troops, who served as an escort while providing close defence against enemy attacks. Only nine tanks reached the German lines to engage machine gun emplacements and troop concentrations. On the way, 14 broke down or were ditched, another 10 were damaged by enemy fire.In 1917, during thebattle of Cambrai, theTank Corpsadopted new tactics. Three tanks working together would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon.[75]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBull200253-75")The tanks were to create gaps in the barbed wire for the accompanying infantry to pass through, then use their armament to suppress the German strong points. The effectiveness of tankinfantry co-operation was demonstrated during the battle, when Major GeneralGeorge Harperof the51st (Highland) Divisionrefused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.[76]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005251%E2%80%93252-76")The situation had changed again by 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or 200yd (180m), with a tank company of 1216 tanks per objective. Onesectionof each company would be out in front, with the remainder of the company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came across an enemy strong point, they would engage the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to the devices of the following infantry.[77]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBull200256-77") Artillery tactics[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=11")] 220px-British_39th_Siege_Battery_RGA_Somme_1916.jpg ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:British_39th_Siege_Battery_RGA_Somme_1916.jpg") 8in (203mm) howitzers("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BL_8_inch_Howitzer_Mk_I_%E2%80%93_V")of the 39th Siege Battery,Royal Garrison Artillery("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Garrison_Artillery")conducting a shoot in the Fricourt-Mametz valley, August 1916, during the battle of the Somme. Prior to the war, the artillery worked independently and was taught to support the infantry to ensure a successful attack. In 1914, the heaviest artillery gun was the 60-pounder, four in each heavy battery. TheRoyal Horse Artilleryemployed the 13-pounder, while theRoyal Field Artilleryused the 18-pounder gun. By 1918, the situation had changed; the artillery were the dominant force on the battlefield. Between 1914 and 1918, the Royal Field Artillery had increased from 45 field brigades to 173 field brigades,[78]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGudmundsson200555-78")while the heavy and siege artillery of theRoyal Garrison Artilleryhad increased from 32 heavy and six siege batteries to 117 heavy and 401 siege batteries. With this increase in the number of batteries of heavier guns, the armies needed to find a more efficient method of moving the heavier guns around.It was proving difficult to find the number ofdraught horsesrequired. TheWar Officeordered over 1,000Holts caterpillar tractors, which transformed the mobility of the siege artillery.[79]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClarkDelf20047%E2%80%938-79")The army also mounted a variety of surplus naval guns on various railway platforms to provide mobile long-range heavy artillery on the Western Front.[80]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-80")Until 1914, artillery generally fired overopen sightsat visible targets, the largest unit accustomed to firing at a single target was the artillery regiment or brigade.One innovation brought about by the adoption of trench warfare was thebarragea term first used in thebattle of Neuve Chapellein 1915. Trench warfare had created the need forindirect fire, with the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern; in the case of a barrage, the pattern was a line.Thecreeping barragewas a barrage that lifted in small increments, perhaps 50yd (46m), so that it moved forward slowly, keeping pace with the infantry, who were trained to follow close behind the moving wall of their own fire, often as close as 55yd (50m); infantry commanders were encouraged to keep their troops as close to the barrage as possible, even at the risk of casualties fromfriendly fire.[81]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETucker2001356-81")[82]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHogg197113,_21,_25%E2%80%9326-82")A creeping barrage could maintain the element of surprise, with guns opening fire only shortly before the assault troops moved off. It was useful when enemy positions had not been thoroughly reconnoitred, as it did not depend on identifying individual targets in advance.The idea behind the creeping barrage was that the infantry should reach the enemy positions before the defenders had time to recover, emerge from shelters, and man their positionsOn the first day of thebattle of the Somme, the barrage outpaced the infantry, allowing the defenders to recover and emerge from theirdugouts, with disastrous results for the attackers.[83]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHogg197126-83")The creeping barrage demonstrated its effectiveness a year later, in 1917, during theSecond Battle of Arras.[84]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicholls200553%E2%80%9354-84")A weakness of the creeping barrage was that the infantry was subordinated to the artillery schedule, while the infantry commanders had less control over the tactical situation and were therefore in danger of forgetting how to manoeuvre their troops around the battlefield. The importance of the barrage was such that traditional infantry tactics, including a reliance on the infantry's own firepower to support its movement forward, was sometimes forgotten.[85]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffith199667-85")[81]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETucker2001356-81")Once the infantry had reached the German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to thestanding barrage, a static barrage ahead of the infantry that would protect them from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was thebox barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a boxor more often three sides of a boxaround a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protecttrench raids,[86]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEConnelly200685-86")although it could also be used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was theSOSbarrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing aflaresignal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.[87]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffith199641%E2%80%9344-87")With the introduction of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery withcounter-battery fire.[88]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBailey1989142-88")British Army researchers under LieutenantWilliam Lawrence Braggdevelopedsound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing.[89]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBragg197131%E2%80%9340-89")A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers.[90]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffith1996152%E2%80%93153-90")By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916. Communications[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=12")] TheRoyal EngineersSignal Service, formed in 1912, was given responsibility for communications that included signaldispatch,telegraph, telephone and laterwirelesscommunications, from army headquarters to brigade and down to battery level for the artillery.[91]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-sig-91")For most of the war, the Army's primary methods of communication were signal dispatch (employing runners, messengers on horseback, dogs, andcarrier pigeons), visual signalling, telegraph, and telephone.[91]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-sig-91")At the start of the war, the Army had a small number of wireless sets, which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated onlongwave. In 1915, trench wireless sets were introduced, but the transmissions were easily intercepted by the listening Germans.Civilian telephones were used at the outset of the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, thefield telephonewas designed; a device that operated with its ownswitchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with aMorse codekey, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.The primary types of visual signalling wereSemaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and theheliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 words a minute with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire. During the war, the Army also trained animals for use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay telephone and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack.[91]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-sig-91")Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.[91]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-sig-91") Royal Flying Corps[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=13")] Main articles:Royal Flying CorpsandList of aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_of_the_Royal_Flying_Corps") 220px-Royal_Flying_Corps_poster.jpg Royal Flying Corps("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps")the First World War recruiting poster At the start of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in the Field, commanded bySir David Hendersonconsisted of five squadronsoneobservation balloonsquadron (RFC No 1 Squadron) and four aeroplane squadrons (Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5). These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914, but only became efficient when they perfected the use ofwireless communicationatAubers Ridgeon 9 May 1915.Aerial photographywas attempted during 1914, but again, it only became effective the following year. In August 1915, GeneralHugh Trenchardreplaced Henderson. The British use of air power evolved during the war, from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line. The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals; in April 1917, (known asBloody April), the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft. Not until late 1917, with the introduction of theSopwith Cameland theS.E.5, were they able to compete successfully for control of the air.[92]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMillettMurray198854-92")[93]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFranksVan_Wyngarden200736-93") On 17 August 1917, GeneralJan Smutspresented a report to the War Council concerning the future ofair power. Given its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial targets and centres of population on a vast scale'. He recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the Army and Royal Navy. The formation of the new service, however, would make use of the under-utilised men and machines of theRoyal Naval Air Service(RNAS), as well as ending the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement. On 1 April 1918, the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated to form a new service, theRoyal Air Force(RAF). The RAF was under the control of the equally newAir Ministry. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from 15,000ft (4,600m) and interpreted by over 3,000 personnel. Planes did not carryparachutesuntil 1918, though they had been available since before the war. After starting with some 2,073 personnel in 1914, the RAF had 4,000combat aircraftand 114,000 personnel by the beginning of 1919.[94]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeckettSimpson1985254-94") Corps of Royal Engineers[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=14")] On 1 August 1914, the Royal Engineers consisted of 25,000 officers and men in the regular army and reserves; by the same date in 1917, it had grown to a total of 250,000.[95]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-reng-95")In 1914, when the BEF arrived in France, there were two Engineer field companies attached to each infantry division, which was increased to three companies by September 1914.[96]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-96")Each division also had a Signals company, which was responsible for communications between Corps, Division and Brigade headquarters.[97]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-97")Royal Engineer tunnelling companieswere formed in response to the German blowing of 10 small mines in December 1914, atGivenchy.[98]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-retun-98")The first British mine was detonated atHill 60on 17 February 1915. Mining was used increasingly during theBattle of Aubers Ridgein May 1915, and thebattle of Loosin September 1915. In July 1916, on the first day of the battle of the Somme, what became known as theLochnagar Craterwas created by a mine atLa Boisselle.[98]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-retun-98")Twenty-one companies were eventually formed and were employed digging subways, cable trenches,Sapping, dugouts as well as offensive or defensive mining.[98]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-retun-98")At the end of the war, Engineers were directly responsible for maintaining buildings and designing the infantry front-line fortifications and artillery positions, the telephones, wireless and other signalling equipment, railways, roads, water supply, bridges and transport. They also operated the railways and inland waterways.[95]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-reng-95") Machine Gun Corps[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=15")] In September 1915, theMachine Gun Corps(MGC) was formed to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a proposal was made to the War Office for the formation of a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigadea goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions.[99]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-mcg-99")Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries.[99]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-mcg-99")In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry.[99]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-mcg-99")They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads[99]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-mcg-99")and from the flanks[100]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEConnelly200666-100")of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.[99]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-mcg-99") Tank Corps[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=16")] TheTank Corps("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Tank_Regiment")was formed as theHeavy Section Machine Gun Corpsin 1916. Tanks were used for the first time in action in the battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. The intention being that they would crush the barbed wire for the infantry, then cross the trenches and exploit any breakthrough behind the German lines. In November 1916, they were renamed the Heavy Branch MGC and in June 1917, the Tank Corps.[101]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHofmann200653%E2%80%9354-101")[102]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinton1972178-102") Originally formed in Companies of the Heavy Branch MGC, designated A, B, C and D; each company of four sections had six tanks, three male and three female versions (artillery or machine guns), with one tank held as a company reserve.[103]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-tankc-103")In November 1916, each company was reformed as a battalion of three companies, with plans to increase the Corps to 20 battalions, each Tank Battalion had a complement of 32 officers and 374 men.[103]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-tankc-103")Tanks were primarily used on the Western Front. The first offensive of the war in which tanks were useden massewas thebattle of Cambraiin 1917; 476 tanks started the attack, and the German front collapsed. At midday the British had advanced five miles behind the German line. Thebattle of Amiensin 1918 saw the value of the tank being appreciated; 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 tanks were included in the assault. 342Mark Vsand 72Whippetswere backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to carry forward supplies for the armour and infantry.By the end of the first day of the attack, they had penetrated the German line by 68mi (9.712.9km), 16,000 prisoners were taken. In September 1918, the British Army was the most mechanised army in the world. Some 22,000 men had served in the Tank Corps by the end of the war. A detachment of eight obsolescent Mark I tanks was sent to Southern Palestine in early 1917 and saw action against Turkish forces there.[104]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005407-104")[105]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffithsGriess2003155-105")[106]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave20095-106")[107]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHumble197729-107") Army Service Corps[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=17")] TheArmy Service Corps(ASC) operated the transport system to deliver men, ammunition and matriel to the front. From 12,000 men at the start of the war, the Corps increased in size to over 300,000 by November 1918.[108]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-asc-108")In addition they had under command Indian, Egyptian, Chinese (Chinese Labour Corps) and other native labourers, carriers and stores men.[108]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-asc-108")They provided horsed and mechanical transport companies, theArmy Remount Serviceand ASC Labour companies.[108]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-asc-108")In August 1914, they delivered 4,500,000lb (2,000,000kg) of bread to the front which increased to 90,000,000lb (41,000,000kg) by November 1918.[108]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-asc-108") Royal Army Medical Corps[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=18")] TheRoyal Army Medical Corps(RAMC) supplied the doctors, casualty evacuation, field ambulances and hospitals for the army.[109]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-ramc-109")The Corps was assisted in its work by voluntary help from theBritish Red Cross,St John's Ambulanceand theFriends Ambulance Unit.[109]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-ramc-109")The only person to be awarded theVictoria Crosstwice during the war was a doctor in the RAMC,CaptainNoel Godfrey Chavasse,VC and Bar,MC.[110]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-110")While not strictly a member of the RAMC, stretcher bearerLance CorporalWilliam Harold ColtmanVC,DCM& Bar,MM& Bar, was the most decoratedother rankof the war.[111]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004471-111") Life in the trenches[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=19")] Main article:Trench warfare("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare") 220px-Trench_construction_diagram_1914.png Trench construction diagram, from a 1914 British infantry manual By the end of 1914, the war on the Western Front had reached stalemate and the trench lines extended from the Belgian coast to the Swiss frontier. By September 1915, the length of the British front line stretched some 70mi (110km). Soldiers were in the front or reserve line trenches for about eight days at a time, before being relieved.[112]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-trench-112")There were three trenches in a typical front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually about four or five feet deep, or in areas with a highwater tablea wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined withduckboardsto prevent men from sinking into the mud anddugoutswere cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents at the bottom of the trench on the duckboards.[113]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-miller-113")At the front, soldiers were in constant danger from artillery shells, mortar bombs and bullets and as the war progressed they also faced aerial attack. Some sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life comparatively easy. Other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. However, quiet sectors still amassed daily casualties throughsnipers, artillery fire and disease. The harsh conditions, where trenches were often wet and muddy and the constant company of lice and rats which fed on unburied bodies, often carried disease. Many troops suffered fromtrench foot,trench feverandtrench nephritis.They could also contractfrostbitein the winter months and heat exhaustion in the summer. The men were frequently wet and extremely muddy, or dry and exceedingly dusty.[112]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-trench-112")[114]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-glasgow-114")Food could not usually be cooked in the front line trenches as any smoke would draw enemy fire, hot food had to be carried along communication trenches in clumsy "hayboxes", sometimes arriving late or not at all. Daily routine[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=20")] 220px-Cheshire_Regiment_trench_Somme_1916.jpg ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cheshire_Regiment_trench_Somme_1916.jpg") A sentry of theCheshire Regiment("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Regiment")in 1916. Note the four men sleeping in the trench Daily routine of life in the trenches began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, it was time for the men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive,sleep deprivationwas common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.[115]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-115")Each side's front line was constantly under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted until after the dusk stand-to and night had fallen.[116]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-routine-116")Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation.Trench raidingwas also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew thebarbed wireinno man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.[116]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-routine-116") Moving into the front line[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=21")] A set procedure was used by a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would be taken to the forward areas to reconnoiter the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, and the manner in which they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving.Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in.Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.[117]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-movetrench-117") Discipline[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=22")]Legal authority[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=23")] The Army was ultimately under political authority. Since theGlorious Revolutionof 1688 the Crown has not been permitted a standing army in the United Kingdom it derived its existence from the Army Act, passed by Parliament each year. Most disciplinary regulations in the First World War derived from the 1881 Army Act, although some offences were more severely dealt with on active service, e.g. in principle looting or wilful disobedience carried the death penalty.[118]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002216,_219-118")[119]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave2009208-119") Lesser offences[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=24")] Lesser offences were dealt with by commanding officers. For petty offences, a company commander could have men fined or confined to barracks for fatigue duty. A battalion Commanding Officer could give detention, order up to 28 days Field Punishment, or demote corporals to the ranks (officers and senior NCOs were dealt with by court martial other than for very trivial offences).Other rankscould also lose leave or seniority.[120]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002217%E2%80%93219,_222-120")Field punishment("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_punishment")(FP) No.1 (in which the man was shackled to a fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking a man in a shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.[121]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002225-121")Striking an inferior was an offence but it was not uncommon in some units for officers to turn a blind eye to NCOs keeping discipline by violence, or even to do so themselves.[122]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004555,_557%E2%80%93558,_560%E2%80%93561,_563-122") Courts martial[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=25")] Men who committed serious offences were tried by Field General Court Martial, sometimes resulting in execution. Despite "assertions" that these were "kangaroo courts", the release of records in 19901994 showed that they in fact had strict rules of procedure and a duty to uncover the facts. Unlike a General Court Martial in peacetime, there was no legally qualified Judge-Advocate to advise the court, but from the start of 1916 a "Court Martial Officer" usually an officer with legal experience in civilian life was often present to do so. The accused was entitled to object to the composition of the panel (e.g. if one of the officers was connected with the case or had a poor relationship with the accused) and to present his case, defended by an officer (a "Prisoner's Friend") if he chose, although "Prisoners Friends" became more common as the war went on.The officer who convened a court martial could not sit on it, and the most junior officer voted first (to lessen the chance of his deferring to a superior's opinion). However, the courts were explicitly intended to be "speedy" and were sometimes encouraged by higher authority to make an example of certain offences, and in practice the leniency of the court and the ability of the accused to defend himself varied widely. Some pleaded guilty or chose not to present a defence or call witnesses, and in most cases the offence was "so blatant that little defence could be put forward".[123]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave2009201,_203,_216%E2%80%93217-123")Eighty-nine per cent of courts martial returned a guilty verdict, the vast majority of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct. Of the 252 officers tried, 76 per cent were found guilty, the most common offence (52 per cent of cases) being drunkenness. Although three officers were executed, an officer was most likely to receive a severe reprimand (60 per cent of cases a severe blow to his career) or be cashiered (30 per cent of cases stripped of his commission, which brought total social disgrace and barred him from any employment under the Crown).[124]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002225%E2%80%93226-124")[125]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004563,_565-125") Executions[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=26")] A death sentence had to be passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the chain of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals tended to be more concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre. Of the 3,080 men sentenced to death, 346 men were actually executed, the vast majority (266) for desertion, the next largest reasons for execution being murder (37 these men would probably have been hanged under civilian law at the time) and cowardice (18). Convictions for mutiny were rareonly one man was shot for theEtaples disturbances in 1917. Of the men shot, 91 were already under a previous suspended sentence, and nine under two sentences. Of the 91, 40 were already under a suspended death sentence, 38 of them for desertion, and one man had already been "sentenced to death" twice for desertion.[126]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave2009199,_201%E2%80%93202-126")[127]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002229,_230,_232-127")It was felt at the time that an example needed to be made of men who deserted. Frontline soldiers sometimes felt that those who left their mates "in the lurch" by deserting "deserved to be shot". One historian writes that there is "virtually no evidence" that soldiers thought the death penalty unjust, although another writes that some soldiers deplored the death penalty, while most thought it justified.[128]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004559-128")Desertion normally meant an absence of 21 days or other evidence to indicate intent of not returning. Those executed were normally not boys the average age was in the mid-twenties and 40 percent had been in serious trouble before. Thirty percent were regulars or reservists, 40 percent were Kitchener volunteers, 19 percent were Irish, Canadian or New Zealand volunteers, but only nine percent were conscripts, suggesting indulgence to the conscripts.Only executed men's records survive, so it is hard to comment on the reasons why men were reprieved. The policy of commuting 90 percent of death sentences may have been deliberate mercy in the application of military law designed for a small regular army recruited from the rougher elements of society. Only 7,361 of the 38,630 desertions were in the field. Most were away from the front line14 of the executed deserters were arrested in the United Kingdomand many deserters had never served in the front line. In the latter part of the war, executed men's families were usually told white lies by the authorities; their families received pensions, and the men were buried in the same graves as other dead soldiers. Of 393 men sentenced to death for falling asleep on sentry duty in all theatres in the First World War, only two were executed (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served inMesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together, suggesting that they had colluded).Australians made up seven percent of the British Expeditionary Force but 25 percent of deserters, while an Australian was nine times more likely to be imprisoned than a British soldier. Haig asked for permission to shoot Australians, but their government refused. British discipline of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other armies of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians). The French admitted to only 133 executions and the Germans 48, but these figures may not be reliable as both armies had problems with discipline.[129]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave2009196_199%E2%80%93200,_204_201,_206,_209%E2%80%93210,_214,_216-129")[130]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002230_232,_236-130") Shell shock and pardons[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=27")] At the timePosttraumatic stress disorder(known as "shell shock") was beginning to be recognised and was admissible in defence; it was classified as a war injury, although there were concerns that soldiers tried falsely to claim shell shock as a defence. One historian writes that "in no case was a soldier whom the medical staff certified as suffering from shell shock actually executed", that "there appear to have been very few cases where men who alleged shell shock, but whose claim was denied, were actually executed", and that the suggestions of modern campaigners that most of the executed men suffered from shell shock are "palpably untrue".However, another historian has pointed out that there was a great deal of chance in whether a soldier's claim of shell-shock would be taken seriously, and gives examples of soldiers being given cursory medical examinations or none; specific references to shell-shock are uncommon, and records usually refer to dizziness, "queer turns", bad nerves etc. Such trauma was still poorly understood at that time. There were enquiries in 1919, 1922, 1925 and 1938, which examined documents now lost and witnesses now dead. The books "For the Sake of Example" (1983) by Babington and "Shot at Dawn" (1989) by Sykes & Putkowski were openly intended to start a campaign for pardons, though it was initially rejected.[131]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorrigan2002233%E2%80%93235-131")[132]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004565,_569-132")[133]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondCave2009197,_202,_218-133")In 2006 all men were given pardons and recognised as victims of the First World War. However, their sentences were not overturned as it was impossible after this length of time to re-examine the evidence in every case.[134]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-134") Other discipline[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=28")] There are only anecdotal accounts, and no figures, for men who were shot on the spot by officers and NCOs for "cowardice in the face of the enemy". There were over 13,000 Royal Military Police ("redcaps"). They were unpopular, at a time when the police were often unpopular with young men from big cities. Besides policing, a large part of their job was maintaining discipline on the march and keeping roads running smoothly, and collecting stragglers from a battle. During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military Police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by Military Police.[a]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-137") Positive motivation[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=29")] New medals were instituted: the Military Cross was created in December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for other ranks in March 1916 (although it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire was instituted in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week to ensure that the man lived long enough to receive it. Concert parties (including drag acts good drag queens were in great demand), trips to the seaside and football matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the "Wipers Times". Overt patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister)H. H. AsquithandRamsay MacDonald(an opponent of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.[137]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolmes2004583%E2%80%93584,_602%E2%80%93604,_607-138") Morale Fragility 1917-18[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=30")] By the end of 1917, after the horrific conditions of theBattle of Passchendaeleand the disappointing results of theBattle of Cambrai, and with neither victory nor an end to the war in sight, there was some evidence of morale problems in the BEF. By the end of 1917 the Cabinet Committee on Manpower were hearing about an alarming rise in drunkenness, desertions and psychological disorders, and reports of soldiers' returning from the front grumbling about "the waste of life" at Ypres.Martin Middlebrook wrote that whereas officers who cracked up under the strain were often quietly reposted to duties away from the front line, this outlet was seldom available to "other ranks". By the end of 1917 there was a noticeable rise in self-inflicted wounds and men making themselves ill by sleeping in wet sheets or chewing cordite. It is hard to estimate the number of suicides as such men were generally listed as "Killed In Action". Middlebrook commented that it is hard to generalise about the state of British morale, as it varied a great deal between units, with former regular and territorial units probably retaining a core of motivated men. Whereas other armies had problems with discipline, apart from theEtaples mutinyBritish discipline generally held up, both in combat and out of it.[138]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiddlebrook1971300-139")[139]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodward1998148%E2%80%93149-140") Western Front[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=31")] Main article:Western Front (World War I)("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)") Under the command ofField MarshalSir John French,[31]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPearceStewart2002289%E2%80%93290-31")the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) began to deploy to France within days of thedeclaration of war.

However, he was repulsed at thefirstandsecond battle of Gazain 1917.[174]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-176")The defeat in the Second Battle of Gaza prompted theWar Officeto change the command of the EEF, and on 28 June 1917, Murray was replaced by General Sir Edmund Allenby, who reinvigorated the campaign.[175]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-177") Allenby reorganised his forces along more conventional lines. The EEF now included theDesert Mounted Corps, underLieutenant GeneralSirHarry Chauvel;XX Corpsunder Lieutenant General SirPhillip ChetwodeandXXI Corpsunder Lieutenant GeneralEdward Bulfin.[176]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-178")In October 1917, they defeated the Turkish forces in thethird battle of Gazaand theBattle of Mughar Ridge, which succeeded in causing theOttomanSeventh and Eighth Armies to withdraw towardsJerusalemandHaifarespectively. This led to thecapture of Jerusalemin December 1917.[166]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-otherfronts-168") In February and April 1918, Australian mounted troops took part in two raids east across the Jordan River near Es Salt, a village in Palestine 14mi (23km) west ofAmman. Although these raids were unsuccessful, they encouraged Turkish commanders to believe that the main British effort would be launched across the Jordan, when in fact it would be launched along the coastal plain.[177]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-179")The EEF was greatly weakened at this time by the crisis in France, which led to the despatch of the 52nd and 74th Divisions to the Western Front, the breaking up of the Yeomanry Mounted Division, and the replacement of most of the British infantry in four of the remaining divisions with Indian troops.[178]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-180")In September 1918, Allenby's forces won the decisiveMegiddo Offensive, which precipitated theArmistice of Mudroswith the Ottoman Empire, which was signed on 31 October 1918.[179]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKarsh2001327-181") Total Allied casualties in the Sinai and Palestine campaign were 60,000 of which 20,000 were killed. Some 15,000 of the dead were British.[166]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-otherfronts-168") Persia[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=41")] Main article:Caucasus Campaign("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Campaign") Following theabdication of the Russian Tsarin 1917, theCaucasus Frontcollapsed, leaving Central Asiaand beyond it Indiaopen to the Turkish Army. TheWar Officeresponded with a plan to send a force of hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight theTurkish forces. This force became known asDunsterforceafter its commander,Major GeneralLionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character ofRudyard Kipling's novelStalky & Co.It arrived inBakuin August 1918. It was hoped that Dunsterforce could raise an army from the ChristianGeorgian, Armenian andAssyrianpeople who had supported theRussiansand had historically feared the Turks. While Dunsterforce had some success the task proved beyond its ability.[180]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBean1937728%E2%80%93731-182") Fighting the Senussi Arabs[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=42")] Main article:Senussi Campaign("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi_Campaign") In late November 1915, in response to the growing threat from a pro-Turkish Islamic Arab sect known as theSenussi, a composite British body known as the 'Western Frontier Force' was sent into theLibyan DeserttoMersa Matruh, under the command of British Indian Army officer Major General Alexander Wallace. A series of sharp battles against the Arabs ensued at Um Rakhum, Gebel Medwa, and Halazin during December and January. The Western Desert Force, now under Major GeneralWilliam Peyton, re-occupiedSidi BarraniandSallum("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallum")in February and March 1916. Shipwrecked British seamen from HMTMoorinaand HMSTara, who had been held at Bir Hakeim, were rescued by a contingent ofarmoured carsled by theDuke of Westminster.[181]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBean1937959%E2%80%93964-183") Aftermath[edit("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Army_during_the_First_World_War&action=edit&section=43")] Further information:History of the British Army Inter-war period (19191939)("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Army#Inter-war_period_(1919%E2%80%931939)") 250px-The_Hundred_Days_Offensive,_August-november_1918_Q7733.jpg Grave of Second Lieutenant Philip Gillespie Bainbrigge of the 5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, attached to the 16th (Service) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, killed in action on 18 September 1918, amongst other graves near Lechelle. The British Army during theFirst World Warwas the largest military force that Britain had put into the field up to that point.On theWestern Front, theBritish Expeditionary Forceended the war as the strongest fighting force, more experienced than theUnited States Armyand its morale was in better shape than theFrench Army.[182]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTETuckerRoberts2005816-184")[c]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-185") The cost of victory, however, was high. The official "final and corrected" casualty figures for the British Armyincluding theTerritorial Forcewere issued on 10 March 1921. The losses for the period between 4 August 1914 and 30 September 1919 included 573,507 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes" and 254,176missing(minus 154,308 releasedprisoners of war), for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. Casualty figures also indicated that there were 1,643,469wounded.[183]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArmy_Council192162%E2%80%9372-186")For some, the fighting did not end in 1918. The British Army dispatched troops to Russia during theAllied intervention in the Russian Civil War, which was followed by theAnglo-Irish Warin January 1919 and theThird Anglo-Afghan Warin May 1919.[184]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarthorp2002152-187")The Third Afghan War was followed by the1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes. Those not involved in fighting or occupation duties were demobilised. The demobilisation of 4,000,000 men that followed the end of the war had, within a year, reduced the British Army to 800,000 men; by November 1920, two years after the signing of theArmistice, this figure had fallen to 370,000 men.[185]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_First_World_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJeffery198413-188") TheTen Year Rulewas introduced in August 1919, which stipulated that theBritish Armed Forcesshould draft their estimates "on the assumption that theBritish Empirewould not be engaged in any great war during the next ten years". In 1928,Winston Churchill, asChancellor of the Exchequer, successfully urged the Cabinet to make the rule self-perpetuating and hence it was in force unless specifically countermanded. There were cuts in defence spending as a result of this rule, falling from 766 million in 19191920, to 189 million in 19211922, and to 102 million in 1932. The British Army tried to learn the lessons of the First World War, and adopt them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, and much of the 1930s, the General Staff tried to establish a small, mechanised, professional army and formed theExperimental Mechanized Forcebut, with the lack of any identified threat, its main function reverted togarrison("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison")duties around the British Empire.

Text: Third Ypres Campaign The Third Battle of Ypres (31 July - 10 November 1917) has come to symbolise the horrors associated with thewar on the Western Front. It is frequently known by the name of the village where it culminated Passchendaele("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/voices-of-the-first-world-war-passchendaele"). The area surrounding the Belgian town of Ypres was a key battleground throughout the war. By 1917 British forces were suffering steady casualties there, holding a salient surrounded by higher ground.Sir Douglas Haig("https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205087462")planned to break out of this poor position and, by capturing an important rail junction a few miles to the east, to undermine the whole German position in Flanders. If this succeeded he hoped to threaten the German submarine base at Bruges as theGerman U-boat campaign("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-u-boat-campaign-that-almost-broke-britain")was threatening Britain with defeat. A preliminary operation to seize the Messines Ridge was a dramatic success, but the Germans had reinforced their position by the time the main battle was launched on 31 July. Initial attacks failed due to over-ambitious plans and unseasonal rain. The drainage of the low-lying battlefield had been destroyed by the bombardment, creating muddy conditions that made movement difficult. Drier conditions in September enabled British forces to make better progress during this phase of the offensive. This demoralised the Germans, who did not have an answer to the British 'bite and hold' tactics of taking limited portions of German positions and holding it against counter-attacks that cost the German Army further casualties. This period encouraged Haig to continue the offensive in October. But the rain returned and conditions once again deteriorated. Although the Canadians finally captured Passchendaele ridge on 10 November, the vital railway still lay five miles away. The offensive was called off. Many soldiers felt utterly demoralised and the government's confidence in Haig hit a low point. Both sides had suffered heavy casualties, but the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had made no strategic gain.

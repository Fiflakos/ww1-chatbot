Text: First Battle of the Marne At the start of theFirst World War("http://10.181.226.69/history/first-world-war"), Germany hoped to avoid fighting on two fronts by knocking out France before turning to Russia, Francesally("http://10.181.226.69/history/what-you-need-to-know-about-pre-first-world-war-alliances"). The initial German offensive had some early success, but there were not enough reinforcements immediately available to sustain momentum. The French and British launched a counter-offensive at the Marne (6-10 September 1914) and after several days of bitter fighting the Germans retreated. Germanys failure to defeat the French and the British at the Marne also had important strategic implications. The Russians had mobilised more quickly than the Germans had anticipated and launched their first offensive within two weeks of the wars outbreak. The Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914 ended in German victory, but the combination of German victory in the east and defeat in the west meant the war would not be quick, but protracted and extended across several fronts. The Battle of the Marne also marked the end of mobile warfare on theWestern Front. Following their retreat, the Germans re-engaged Allied forces on the Aisne, where fighting began to stagnate into trench warfare. The opening months of the war caused profound shock due to the huge casualties caused bymodern weapons("http://10.181.226.69/history/how-modern-weapons-changed-combat-in-the-first-world-war"). Losses on all fronts for the year 1914 topped five million, with a million men killed. This was a scale of violence unknown in any previous war. The terrible casualties sustained in open warfare meant that soldiers on all fronts had begun toprotect themselves("http://10.181.226.69/history/10-things-that-could-have-saved-your-life-in-the-trenches")by digging trenches, which would dominate theWestern Frontuntil 1918.

Author: Fred L Biddle Date: 12 February 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Ellsworth.Yours of Jan 1st dulyto hand a week or so ago.I am sorry to find you havehad such a rough passage, but hopeyou are now very nearly, if not quite, OK.We are now reforming & reorganising; &as you can guess re-equipping which is aslow process.Capt Harris (late Agt Dac) has beenpromoted Tempy Major is in command ofthis battery.I hear Major Phillips is likely tobe back any day, & he may possibly takethis battery again.However two more divisions of guns areto be formed here, out of what we havein Egypt. We will go into the new establishmentwhich practically wipes out the Dac & cutsdown the BA.C. considerably.Perhaps Major Phillips will get a brigadeI expect to get a step when the new divisions are formed.No doubt you have heard all thedetails of the evacuation by now.The battery left on the night of 17th &I was left behind for special duty controllingthe embarkation of the troops from AnzacBeach. It was quite a good job, but veryeasily could have been a dirty one, if theTurks had found out what was going on.However everything went OK. we wereputting 430 men on a motor lighter in anaverage of 20 minutes (from mouth of AnzacGully to last man aboard.)The men were splendid & there was nota sound from them or a check of any sortWe made [[5 1/2 ?]] hours in the time allowed onthe second last night, & could easily havedone the same on, the 20th /21st.Lone Pine was held by 18 men for nearly4 hours at the finish & the Turks wereBluffed all the way.Right up to the last the show wasjust like an ordinary night, with theusual amount of trench sniping simulated by men walking up & down potting fromvarious loopholes.In fact by an ingenious arrangementfirst thought out by a corporal of Light Horserifles were firing at odd times up to 30minutes after the last man was out ofthe front line.The blowing up of the Nek was agreat sight, & even then the Turks thoughtwe were about to attack.I embarked when the last of the Australianswere on the beach & everything OK.It was a great experience but thewaiting during the last 4 hours was somewhattrying as so much could result froma "fool" act of a single man.However alls well that ends well.It hurt a bit leaving Lieuts Wolfenden &Siddell & all the old boys behind; but wemanaged to make a triumph out of whatmight easily have been a disaster, & sowere able to hope we hadnt caused themto turn in their graves.I hear Turner has received a commission in the R.F.C. Hope he doesn't talk themto death. If he can only learn to talk lesshe ought to do well, as he undoubtedly hasbrains.I hear young Arrowsmith has alsoreceived a commission in the R.F.A.We are well rid of him, but Im sorryfor the R.F.A.Tell any of the men you see that Ihope they are getting fit, but for anysake not to chase after cold footed jobsin England. There are plenty of B classto fill them & Australians dont do it.Well as I said early in this letter,hope you are now O.K.Thanks for writing.Yours sincerely, Fred. L Biddle

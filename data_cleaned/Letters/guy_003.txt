We have patrolsgo out at night, creep up asnear as possible to theTurks Lines, to get as muchinformation as possible, ofcourse the Turks are upto the same game.Ken was lucky getting toLondon; he will be ableto give you a better ideaof how things are herethan I can on paper.Do you hear very often fromRupert; I suppose he is keepingan eye on burns Creek Farm,just to see how things are gettingon.With loveYour affection son,Guy Arnold. Wishing you a very happyXmas only wish Icould be with you,it is a long long timesince we had the last Xmas together.

Welanded last Sunday week undertremendous fire from our battleships& what a sight it was too: One Ishall never forget. The Turks simplyflew in all directions. The Infantrylanded first & had to drive the Turksfrom some of the biggest & mostrug rugged hills imaginable & theyhave done wonderful in doing so.I landed with my Subsection inthe afternoon & got our gun up on ahill & at once got to work. We wereunder shrapnel fire from 3 differentdirections & we soon located a 6 gunbattery shelling us & we swunground on to them & put themcompletely out of action by 18 shots The Infantry had had a bad timefrom the Turks shrapnel but itput fresh heart into our boys &as our shrapnel is larger thantheirs, they won't stand up to it.We are in a very safe position& are well "dug in" & the shrapnelcan't touch us. We have hadonly 3 of our chaps slightly hitby spent bullets. Jack Heywoodgot hit by a shrapnel bullet inthe leg & has gone on board theHospital Ship. It is not at allserious & he was sent there as wehave no accommodation on the beach.The "Queen Elizabeth" with her15 inch guns, is doing great work& the noise is deafening when shefires the 8 together. The Australian& New Zealand Troops are alldoing magnificently & have provedthemselves that they are not the the 6/- a day tourists that "stay athome" critics say they are. Theywont come out of the trenches evenfor a spell & when the RoyalMarine Light Infantry were sentto relieve them, they all went backagain after an hours spell.The weather is delightful & weshould soon be on our way toConstantinople. My boys are realtricks & think it great sport. Ourhorses are going back to Alexandriatomorrow & this letter goes with them.We go for a swim each eveningso don't do too bad. Our food issplendid & plentiful. The menin the trenches are well fed, etc, &all their stuff is carried by muleswho have proved to be wonderful.The warships bombard night &day & it plays havoc with theTurks I am writing this in our "dug out"& it is getting dark, so excuse mybad writing & mistakes. Jack Hall& Braithwaite are still on theboat & have not been ashore yetso do not know what it is liketo be under fire yet.Now Mother, dont worryabout me, as I am perfectlysafe & know how to look aftermyself. This game suits me toa "T" & I am thoroughly in myglory. Hope all are wellGive my love to all at home &accept same from yourloving & happy sonNorman. about theGuna May 6th 1915 to write to Nell Wheeler16 Argyle St St Kilda& tell her the news for me Please return to mewhen you have read themM Ellsworth

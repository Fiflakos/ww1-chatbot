Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 1 August 1915 Location: Zeitoun Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 5th & 6th Training BattalionsZeitounAugust 1st, 1915.My dear mother,I am writing this beforebreakfast on Sunday morning as Ihad to rise at six o'clock today inorder to examine any troops beforetheir departure for the front as a largenumber of the reinforcements wentaway this morning, almost allthose who came over with us have gonealready. Since I last wrote you I havestill been kept busy but now that almostour whole camp has gone to the DardanellesI shall have a very easy time until more come.The days are so similar here that it ishard to distinguish one from the other.(Dr.) Charley Wesley & I have arranged to meettoday & go somewhere this afternoon& then to church in Cairo - he is aMethodist so we will probably go tohis church first & to mine later. ThePresbyterians have quite a nice littlebuilding. We are not sure, what it wiltime it commences & it is not published in the papers so we may miss it yet,though I believe it is at six oclock.I have had quite an enjoyable weekin many ways as I have been out nearlyevery evening as after being out here allday on the desert with hot sands& glare one enjoys seeing other objectsin the evening & it is really what welive for in Egypt - driving round in a"garry" (two horsed vehicle) in the coolof the evening. I do not mean to saythat it is so exceptionally hot for I havefelt it just as hot in Australia on manyoccasions but the heat & glare iscontinuous whereas it is only in spasmsin Australia. Since I have been here thereappears to have been hardly 10o degreesof variation in the temperature. It commencesearlier in the morning too I think but itis not half as hot as I expected it to be.Most people rest between eleven & fouroclock & go out in the evening - a verysensible idea & most of the shops shutbetween eleven & three oclock. It is afrightfully expensive place to live in fora European although some things aresurprisingly cheap. All foodstuffs such as we eat are very expensive & drinksare awful. At Shepheards Hotel or theContinental where one is expected togo, or visiting the city as all officersgo there it costs 1/- or 1/3 for a softdrink or hard drink as the casemight be, so that will give you someidea & if one goes to town he alwaysgets thirsty & must have something todrink. On the other hand I boughta new uniform, made for me by an Indiantailor near here for 25/- of course notlined like my other one or of such goodstuff, but good serviceable washingmaterial, fits well & looks decent.Then one can get a garry with twohorses to drive you for an hour & ahalf or two hours for 20 piastres or 2/-I have not yet been able to buy any things to sendhome or to the branches of the family as it is necessaryto get to know the value of things first, asin the bazaar where one buys things the nativesalways ask four times the value of the articleI have been seeking Oakes since my arrival& strangely the enough, the first man I mentionedit to here in our mess had been an officerin his regiment & told me that he knew that Oakes had applied for a position assergeant in charge of some clerks & hethought that he had a good chance ofgetting it but was not sure. I then learntlater that he had got it & was in Cairosomewhere & I tried to hunt him up yesterdaybut being Saturday could not lay myhands on him, but I'm sure I'll find him soon.I have received no letters from Australia yet butam looking for some soon - they often be inthe postoffices I believe for a few days. I wishyou would keep these old letters of mine, mydear, as they will serve as a kind of diary,for although I commenced one I have grownlazy & discontinued it. I went one afternoonwith two other fellows from here - young Ceylontea planters - out to the Barage which I thinkoccurred since my last letter. The Barage is alarge dam on the Nile constructed by Britishenterprise which will keep the level of thewater at the necessary height, which canbe altered as the dam has moveable gateswhich can be slid upwards or downwards.Before this was constructed the Egyptiansrelied on the annual outflowing of theNile to do their irrigation for them & ifthe Nile fell below a certain level they did not get any water or crops at all. Byconstructing the dam however the watercan be kept at a high enough levelto overflow into the canals leading allover the flat country around which is thusnot only irrigated every year but all the yearround & they produce I believe 4 crops ofcertain substances. You realize how flatthe country is when keeping the water dammedback & raising it's level by a few feet willcause it to irrigate all the land. We wentto Cairo by rail electric car & then took the train to the Barageabout 40 minutes trip - beastly hot it wastravelling too & were then taken from thetrain by trolly's pushed by two nativeson narrow lines to the Barage about1 miles away. We passed through adirty miserable native village & then onto beautiful gardens around the Nile.After being on the desert the sight ofacres of gardens green as Killarneywith thick couch grass everywhereshrubs & flowers was delightful.We first passed over one small harchof the Nile & then over the main damwhich also serves as a bridge &is moveable at one end to allow the sailing boats or felucas, of which thereare a great number, to pass through& at this part they have gates soas to form a lock. As soon as we alightedfrom our trolly we were seized by a fellowwho wanted to bring us English tea & foolishlywe consented for after waiting some time hebrought four cups a teapot which containedenough wretched tea to half fill the cups,& two biscuits each, some dirty lookingmilk & forgot the sugar. He wanted16 piastres (3/4) for it but did not get it.While eating our tea we were constantly worried bypeople wanting to perform for us - a man witha guinea pig & a pack of cards worried us firsttill we threw a glass at him, then a dancing lady& her husband whom we had difficulty in passingoff, then I noticed a man with a monkeysidling along & he had to be forcibly ejected.We then returned to Cairo & the other lads wantedto go to Shepherds for dinner & I had tojoin them - it is very good but abominablyexpensive. I had some sole, mixed grilllemonade coffee & cigar for 6/-. Everythingis served well & is very good but one can'tdo it too frequently. We then toddled offhome. Dinner at these places never comes on until 8 o'clock & lasts a long timeOne other night, Wesley, Flannery & myselfwent into Cairo in the afternoon hadlight tea there & I walked round the cityfor a while, then engaged a garry &went round the gardens called pronounced"Geeza" I don't know how it's spelt.They lie just on the outskirts ofCairo on the Nile & one drives tothem through a very pretty portionof the city where the Savoy Hotel - nowclosed - Italian embassy & a numberof other fine places. We crossed abridge on the Nile of which thereare three in this locality & thendrove through miles & miles oftrees & gardens in the moonlight- it was gorgeous. We stopped ata French cafe & had some very nicecoffee & cakes & drove back again.The Nile is a very wide & deep streamabout here - I suppose 300 - 400yards across & so very pretty withthe moon shining on it & sailing boatsflitting about. One of the nurseswho came over with us named Baileyis a friend of Mrs Cook alia nee Sheppard whose wedding I attended some monthsago in Sydney you remember & LieutenantCook came to the front & has beenpromoted to Captain. Mrs Cook came as a nurse& is at No TT Aust. Hospital a few miles away.Nurse Bailey got into communication with her &Mrs Cook she arranged a motor drive with some friendwho had a car so six of us went fora drive to the Barage again oneevening - left about six o'clock fromHeliopolis & got to the Barage aboutseven. We took eatables down with us &bought some liquid down there & had quitea nice little tea. Then we had to drive backas Mrs Cook was on duty at nine o'clock& we allowed only just enough time onthe return trip & of course had a puncturewhich took 15 minutes to adjust &so poor Mrs C was late. We went rightback with her to No TT Hospital at.Gazirah about 1 mile on the other sideof Cairo & then drove round Cairo hada look at the Sultan's palace whichis a tremendous bare building builtright on the street & got back toHeliopolis about 11 o'clock boughtsome supper & came home. I forgot to mention that Flannery was with us then. He is aLieutenant & has just gone to the Dardanelles today. Hecame on the Karoola with us & I too came to like himimmensely & he was stationed at this camp with me.He was just finishing up his law course when he left & hadsplendid opportunities which he gave up to come away. Thereseems to be some kind of bond between men who have goneto the same University & Charly Wesley, he & I soon became veryfriendly & we have gone out a lot together since our arrivalhere & when he suddenly received word to go to the frontafter being here only a fortnight I was hugely disappointedHe was an admirable chap in every way. We went to see himoff yesterday afternoon Wesley & myself - drove in by car& picked up our commanding officer Major Norris on theway -&- he is also a Sydney barrister, went to tea at theContinental with him & Flannery had just time to rushoff & catch his train. Wesley & I came back here &went out for a ride. Lunch bell has now gone as Ihave written in too stages so must close & post thiswhen I go to Heliopolis this afternoon.I hope you are in good health & cheerfulmy dear & that each & all of the familywhose eyes may fall on Wilf's old scribblyhand are as well as he is himself.with best wishes & love to all with adouble share to ma mre fromHer loving son,Wilf.

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 5 June 1916 Location: Egypt to France Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Father & Mother -It is nearly a fortnight since I last wrote, butowing to all mails out or in being stopped indefinitely, it hasperhaps been hardly worth writing, even if circumstances hadallowed us time to write letters.Just a fortnight ago today our battn wasstarted off in the new campaign, and as a unit waspulled out of the front line. I finished up on the extremeright near C Township & had a front of nearly 4 miles. Poorold Hippo broke it with the extra work he had to do then,& a remount was sent to me, & fine big upstanding darkbay mare - full of pace & life, so I've decided to stick toher.About a week ago we were relieved, my boys hadto march about 13 miles to the Battn residences, & these arequite a few miles from the Canal. Next day we went fora 10 mile march on the road to get their feet steady,& then next day we packed up & proceeded to entrain. Webivouaced at the station that night & left early nextmorning for Alex, one of the longest troop train journeys Ihave ever done, & we embarked later the same day. Nextmorning early we pushed out & have now been out 2 days.The boys were nearly flagged out for during the past 3weeks they had had an extremely rough time, and manyof them nearly broke down. I am very glad to see. TRIP From Egypt to France 1H.M.T. "Arcadian"5.6.1916.

Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Mena Camp Cairo Egypt Date: 26 December 1914 Nationality: Australian Text: My Dearest Mother & all at Melbourne,I suppose you have been wonderinghow I spent Xmas Day away from home, well, I mustsay that we have not only fared magnificently, butwonderfully. I could scarcely have believed that sucha feast as we had, could have been prepared & cookedin the Sahara Desert. First, we exercised, watered & fedour horses, then we had a Breakfast of Chops, Eggs, Steak& Toast with Coffee (good) to drink, Then we were allowedto take it easy & get ourselves ready for Dinner & we filledin the time by cleaning out the tents & adorning the placewith all kinds of decorations. Our tents are quite differentto the ones we had at Broadmeadows. They are large tentsabout 20 feet long & 12 feet broad and are double to allowthe air to pass all around & they are beautifully cool, Wellwe have lined the outside portion of the ground withwhite stones & the men have made incriptions & drawingson the sand & some of the designs are magnificent.We have fellows from all over the Camp to inspectour lines, & we made such a good job of it, that theColonel & Medical Officer, who made a surprise visitgalloped up to the Major (ours) & congratulated himon the splendid appearance of our lines & he later on brought the Officers of the other batteries overto see our fine display. Well, after watering & feedingour horses, we sat down to DINNER. and what adinner too. For the men, Roast Turkeys, Roast Beefvegetables (leeks, ony carrots turnips & spuds) & of coursein the Turkeys (don't get a shock) ONION STUFFING.Then followed Plum puddings & Brandy Sauce, & whenthese were issued to the men, they were set alight & puton the tables, blazing. I might say that before this, themen were allowed to send in one N.C.O. for eachsubsection to buy Beer & Whisky & Wine & other littledelicacies & afterwards, all that could be seen wasmen lying about in all directions, (dead to the world)The Sergeants dined in a similar manner, only muchmore in style & we all drank to the health of the"Dear ones at Home". The Major went round toeach mess & spoke kindly to everybody & everybodycheered him. I might say that the men have hada large mess room built for them & this adds to thecomfort of a big dinner. There is one thing that Iwant to tell you & that is my subsection sent for meat dinner time & when I went to them, I found that theywanted to Toast me, & in the speech that the Corporalmade, he insisted & all the men "hear heared" that I was the best Sergeant in the Brigade (mind you) & theyrose & sang "For he's a jolly good fellow & all that rot"& gave me three cheers. Well I can't tell you how Ifelt. This is the first time in my life that I have beencheered & I hardly knew what to do or say & stood therelike a silly coot & after they had finished, I madea short speech in which I thanked them all forthe willing & loyal assistance they had given me, &it was my best wish that we would all be togetherthat day, next year, in Berlin. This was a trumpcard & they all cheered like blazes. This was notthe only thing, as I was sent for by the other subsections& toasted the same way & no other Sergeantgot this distinction. I only mention this to showyou how we are doing here & the good fellowshipthat exists between all ranks. After a good sleep,Les Ilsley came in from the New Zealanders Camp &he spent the rest of the day in our company. Wehad arranged, during the week, for a big speadfor 9 of us at 7.30 p.m., & so we went into Cairo ina big Car & after a good hot bath we went to theCafe Parisenne & there we had 10 courses onour big dinner, so you will see our digestiveorgans had to perform wonders on Xmas Day. We finished up at mid night in a fine big Car& slept late next morning, & I must say that everybody looked washed out, but they were all therewhen the Trumpet went. Les Ilsley enjoyed himselfthat much that he is going to apply for a Transferto us. Well so much for our Dinner, now howof about yours. I was thinking of you all athome all day & knew that onion stuffing must havebeen "favourite". We have just heard a Rumour thatthe Herald published a report that we had beenSunk in the Indian Ocean. If this is true, we aregoing to wreck the Herald Office on our return.Our work in the field is progressing favourablyaltho' the training of the Artillery has been alteredsince the outbreak of the war, so we have tolearn a lot of new work. All my subsection areworking great now & they are keen to obey mysmallest wish, & altho I am sorry to say that oneor two "Non Coms" were inclined to be "Cliquey" Ispoke to the Section Officer about them & he spoketo them & pointed out that the success of the "Sub"depended on the absolute friendliness & comradeshipof everybody & this has had the desired affect asthey are all pulling together grand now. Speaking of the Sergeants, I must say that If theworld had been sought over for a finer lot offellows, it would have been impossible to do ones find better.They all assist each other & do all sorts of jobsfor each other, that it is a pleasure to know them& I am happy in the extreme in their company.Moon is about the least popular as he is inclinedto be a little selfish at times & mingy, so we havenick named him (Cohen). Jack Hall is a big joke& is all ways keeping us in the best of humour.Fred Conradis is always doing jobs around theplace & building all sorts of things. We have stillgot of our Gramaphone & we exchange Recordswith other Batteries. The niggers do all the dirty workso we have a good time compared with Broadmeadows.Cairo is still dirty & smelly. The French womenare very beautiful & marry any one with tons of moneyno matter what caste he is. Now Mother, I'llclose now hoping this finds all in Victoria wellSo give my love to all at home, Miss Taylor,Charlie, Hettie & Family, George, Mab, Flos, & allRelations & other enquirers & not forgetting Rupert.Best of Love to your dear selffrom your loving & happy Son,Norman. Mabs birthday tomorrow, so I'll drinkher health & wish her the usual greetings.Am sending her some Cards bythe same mail

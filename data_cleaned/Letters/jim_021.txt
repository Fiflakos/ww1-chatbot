Author: James Joseph Makins Location: Sutton Veny Wilts England Date: 26 September 1918 Nationality: Australian Text: My dear Mother, You will see I am still at this dept, and my stay has been much longer than I expected. I have not had any letters from home since I last wrote - 14th July, the latest. There should be more letters shortly. The weather is still wet and stormy, as one must expect at the time of an equinox. We have started the football season already, and played a match against the 1st. Training Battalion yesterday. Two 5th Bn officers, pals of Les, were playing against us. They recognised me, and spoke very kindly. Three or four other 5th Bn. chaps lamented Les the loss of Les as "one of the battalion's very best." I hope you will not think it was out of place for me to be playing so soon, but you will understand that I felt so worried that I was glad of a game to forget for a while. Somehow I am always thinking of you now, dear mother, and wondering if you are pining, or bearing up bravely against misfortune as behoves a mother of such a fine chap as Les was. I daresay you got my cable alright. Possibly you had a notification from Defence previously. There is absolutely no news to tell you from this side. The news from Palestine and the Balkans is very encouraging, and the Western front has quietened down. I shall write again shortly. Best love to all at home Your affectionate son, Jim.

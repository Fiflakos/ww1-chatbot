I know thereis nothing I can say to make the blow easier to bear, but Ido trust it will mean something to you to realise how gallantlyhe fought, and give his life for the maintenance of justice andfreedom throughout the world.I have seen his O.C. Col. Salisbury, & findthat the Battn letter sent by him was unfortunately lostin the "Mongolia" - and he is sending you another - givingfull particulars of the action - & of his appreciation of your son.Your boy fell at Noreuil a small Frenchvillage near Bullecourt. He had done much and excellentservice for us - and was "Mentioned in despatches" by F. MarshalHaig - (Gazette June 1917) for his good work during thepreceding half year. Col. Salisbury has given you detailsof his great share in all our heavy fighting on the Somme - butI should like again to say how much we regret his loss, whichis a great one to the A.I.F.With my kind regards, and deep sympathyYours SincerelyW.R.

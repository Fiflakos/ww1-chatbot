Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 30 December 1917 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 30.12.1917.My dear Harry,Your welcome note of 15th October arrived a coupleof days ago. You asked about the amount of surgicalexperience one obtains here & from your letter I think you havequite an erroneous idea on the subject, for the amount of medicalor surgical experience one obtains here is absolutely nil. The onlyplace where one obtains any such experience of any use is at basehospital & I fully realized when I determined to leave it overtwo years ago that I was giving that up. In the field one'stime so far as advancement in the profession goes is completelywasted & my capacity as a medical practitioner now ascompared with that when I left Australia is diminishedby some hundreds per cent & becomes worse as time goes on.For that reason I would be very glad to return if I could& pick up again but one can hardly consider one's ownpersonal prospects at a time of national crisis such asthis. And certainly I would not be content to try &squeeze myself into a nice comfortable job at the base atthe expense of an older & probably married man.It hurt considerably at first to realize how much itblighted ones professional career, but I have long sinceceased troubling & resigned myself to the hope of goingback to a hospital after the war or whenever I return &getting professionally fit once more. Of course in the military world as elsewhere thereare selfish people who stick if they can in hospitaljobs but no one here has any time for such people atall & I certainly don't want to be among them.Medical work in the field consists of only veryelementary treatment as all serious cases aresent on to hospital & in the administrative positionone has none at all.Still I can't grumble as I am very well off indeedin my present position.We had a very wet Christmas here & as we areaway up in the rocky hills of Judaea it wasjolly cold too & we spent most of the time, eachin his own little bivouac trying to keep dry.The Turk has had another nasty knock hereduring the last few days, the people on our right havebeen giving him beans & seizing some coveted heights& we also have been advancing but have metwith practically no resistance. The country wehave just advanced over is simply appalling,consisting of a succession of steep rockyhills & deep gullies or wadis as they arecalled here. It is absolutely impossible totake a vehicle of any kind along until the stones are cleared away & a road made & beyondthe points where this is done the problem of removing anywounded is a great one. The old camel is doingmost of it back to the wagons & if this continuessome form of mule litter will have to be adopted Ithink as the poor old camel's feet are not madeto traverse stony country. I like the hills though,I have always done so - environment in boyhoodI suppose, I don't wonder that old Davidmanaged to hide himself away in these places.I described my trip to Jerusalem in mother'sletter which you will receive in due course - soI won't repeat it again.Jack & myself are both very fit indeed& enjoy our occasional meetings.h I have to trot away now & arrange somematters about distribution of Ambulances on accountof a move in sight so must cl concludewith love to Lin & the kiddiesfromYour loving brotherWilf.Padr Gordon was here for Xmas he alwaysasks about you - his bivouac gotbeautifully wet too!!!

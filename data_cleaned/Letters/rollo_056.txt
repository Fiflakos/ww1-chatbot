Anyhow I wasdoing O.C. work for a month & not 21 yet.Our mails are held up in Egypt and ourrelief postponed indefinitely so you may beable to guess 'whats what.I hear Stan, caught double pneumonia whenholidaying in Egypt - & is now invalided toAussie - along with Stopp, Gordon, & Heming.Im the only officer left in C. of those who werehere when I arrived - Shaw is at Battn. H.Q, &Cornish invalided to England - while poor Cullenwas sniped, & succumbed to his wounds.Lorenzo is due from Italy & Cairo - & then Shawwill come back to us - probably to A. & then Illapply for a transfer so as to be with him.At present Im virtually O.C. of C - & my oldN.C.O.s are at work in others' platoons since myabsence - & a lot of dead heads come in their placeThis shifting about plays the deuce with platoons& it makes all the more work for me now.

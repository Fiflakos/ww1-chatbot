We had a little difficulty ingetting here & had to wade across portion of the bay inorder to reach the rest camp, so what with being24 hours without anything to eat, and having our kits tocarry & a good way to walk, we were pretty well goodfor nothing when we got here, but we have been treatedsplendidly ever since, & good" tucker", & no drill, exceptan hours marching in the morning, then we are offfor the rest of the day, & go off to the differentGreek Villages & visit the warships, etc etc & as theweather is fine, you can see we are thoroughlyenjoying ourselves. The Greeks are peculiar peoplebeing content to live a quiet life, in houses built of unshaped stones or mud bricks. Theyare a clean healthy living people & very quiet,but appear to have no ambition to improvetheir mode of living, or get on in any way.The women folk are always spinning cotton &such like, dat as their domestic duties don't take1/2 an hour a day & the men seem to have aneasy life.There are all kinds of troops here, French,British, Senegalese, Zouaves, Australians & other kinds, aswell as a lot of Turkish prisoners, who are a verycontented looking lot, & are well cared for.There are any amount of British & Frenchwarships of all sorts here, & when they to getthrough the narrows, something is sure to happen.The new monitors are torpedo proof & have14 inch guns, so we are expecting great thingsof them.You will be surprised to learn that Ihave broken the pledge & have drunk ahalf bottle of stout one night. I was feelingpretty crook & one of my friends in theMedical unit came & doctored me up & mademe drink it, but oh, what a horrid tasteit has. Never again. Each man gets Let Constable Watson know thatI'm doing alright. Norman.

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 4 July 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: The Artillery can either make or mar in "Raid's" success If the wire isn't smashed - or a thick [[barrage?]] doesn't come between the first [[?forward]] line of enemy trenches - [[?then]] the raiding party has a very "rough" [[skin?]] - very few will get back. Most of our raids have been absolutely free from casualties [[?]] the "[[jetting?]] home" began - as these Fritz begins to [[?]] a barrage of machine gun Artillery between his [[?]] ours, so the return party shifts like greased lightning. Much pain and detailed work occur in planning a raid -a few lines of description of a successful raid - means the result of many hours of careful study & planning. To see a party go out one would fancy it was some sort of "fancy dress stunt". The men black their faces, hands & wear any old clobber - carry rifles with blackened bayonets fixed - knives, [[?]], [[?bombs]], [[knobkerries]] - (last are [[entrenching?]] tools with a bit of horseshoe fixed on for luck My word, Ned Kelly would turn with envy in his grave if he were only told about our ideas & "get up" If you can imagine the effect on [[?poor]] [[?Hans]] of this mob of yelling Australian "blacks" jumping into the remnants of their trenches after 30 min. of our "[[?hate]]". Poor devils - I heard they are going to crucify any Australian they catch with a 'Knobkerry" but they'll have "First to catch him." I saw some Fritzes on their way to our H.Q.] after a good raid last night. 27 By the time they reached us they had lost many [[?buttons]] [[?our]] boys are great in [[?c--]] and it was one of the funniest sights in the world to see a ragged six footer of an Anzac - (black! escorting an equally gigantic Fritz. Bill [[?]] had a "knobkerry" & was helping Fritz along by waving his brass helmet - but as B.I. was wearing a head of about size 7 & Fritzy helmet only filled a size 6 - you can imagine the picture. Especially if you fill up the most picturesque & sanguinary [[Australian---?]] which B.I. used with various yelled war-cries to hurry Fritz along. Some of our wounded came along later. Some laughing, some silent, others [[?]] & cursing generally. My word B.I. can swear when put to it properly. I hope to take out a party before long - it might [[?]] a M.C. or - but one must trust to luck - I dont intend to miss any opportunities, & besides "one hour of [[?glorious]] [[?fame]] is worth a month of ordinary [[?]] fame" I enclose 'Birthday dinner card" - of party given by Major Jack - only 1100 yds from firing line. Keep the "menu" for the autographs may be valuable. Well - I'll write again in a few days - Best of all good wishes - & very much love - hoping you're all as well as I am Yours Rollo

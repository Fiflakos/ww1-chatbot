Text: 1ST ANZAC CORPS.B.E.F., FRANCE.25 March 1918(*Flight to France*)1918My own darlingest, little sweetheart,I did think it was so awfully sweet & braveof you to see me off as you did & I hated leaving you likethat with such an anxious time for [[?]] everyone.I landed quite successfully - just 1 hour & 5 minutes! Itwasn't though what you could describe as a very pleasantvoyage over & the pilot called it a very "bumpy" one. Itwas blowing much harder than you would think, as thewind seemed to increase in strength as time went on.We followed the coast up to Folkestone & then struckacross the Channel where we went to about 4000 feet. Younever saw such a curious sight as it was from there.Down below it seemed to be a fairly cloudy day, butat 4000 we had got above all the clouds whichlay in one mass of white billows below usabsolutely covering the whole of the land. In the middle of the Channel there was a clear belt& one could see ships like small specks movingabout below one. Then when we got to Franceagain the whole country was under cloud. Westruck the coast at Cap Grisnez & worked up toBologne & then turned inland. We then had ofcourse to come down below the cloud, but it wasimpossible to avoid them altogether, so had tokeep falling & rising as we got to belts ofthem - which was uncomfortable. Whileof course the wind roared the whole time.I was doubtful at one time if we shouldbe able to strike the exact aerdrome wewanted, but my pilot brought us along capitally & we made a most excellent landingwithout a bump of any sort a bit before2. McGuigan met me shortly after withthe car & we came along to my Corps H.Q.I am sorry to say one of the beautiful towersof the town where I landed has been destroyedduring my absence by a big shell & thefine organ of the Church near it also destroyed.It was an old tower of [[French?]] architecture & I had hoped would have survived.No orders yet for us to leave here, butsome of my troops have gone, so youmay see references to Australians elsewhere which will not necessarily mean that Iam with them. Chris [[very?]] well indeed& very happy. He tells me he left thatblanket "flea-bag" in a suit case withhis initials on it! I fancy it will be oneof those in the passage. In the mean timeI took his green canvas valise to A.I.F. H.Q.thinking I should be able to get his blankets fromthe [[?]]. Now that this is not the casethe valise may just as well stay there &if you'd remember it will you sendthe blankets up to Genl Griffiths by the first chance you get she canthen send them over in the valise.No more news about Chris going to Rouen.I expect my letter went astray.Will you please be sure to tell MrsBuckley how really sorry I am not tohave seen her this time & tell her itwas only on the Tuesday mnig & this being thatI was in London at all then only for aboutan hour! While I had meant tosee her when we were down for a few days. I expect you will have writtena line to Genl. Howse.All my love to you my own darlinglittle wife. You really are thebest little woman in the world.Ever your very loving old,Will

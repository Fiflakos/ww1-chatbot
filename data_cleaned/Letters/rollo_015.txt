Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Serapeum Date: 6 May 1916 Nationality: Australian Text:We are anxious to take the initiative - & hence our delight in being told we're to go to Rail-head - a place in rear of Habeita. 49 & 50 are under orders - but so far we can only conjecture what'll follow.If we give them a hiding now, it will free Egyptfrom the Turkish menace - & set the A.I.F. free forFrance - for the Katia affair is the cause of us stillbeing here instead of on the Mediterranean.If any scrapping occurs our batts. will be in itbut I understand we are not going to be wasted on a desert campaign - other troops will relieve us - and the L.H. will be just the ones required for such work. We're told we may be out only a few days, & then off to France - but of course rumours are flying & lyingIn a few days I will be able to write definitely.Townsend at Kut put up a good go but had noluck re supplies - & now Jacko may try an Egyptian invasion - but he'll find us ready.Our 'circus' is getting ready - so I must close - mynext letter may be from Gebel or Jerusalem - but will have a bit of scrapping first.Very much love & best of good wishesRolloPt SaidKansaraEl ArishKatiaHassanaJif JaffaIsmaliaHabeitaRailhdMarghsaraSerapeumSuezSin.

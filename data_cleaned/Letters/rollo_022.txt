Another fine day - but as we are presumablygetting near the Leeuwin - a bit of a swell seemsto be rising tonight.

Ships routine may get monotonous -no systematic arrangement of troop decks & paradehours is the cause.Feeling quite well - & exceedingly fit - Received notificationre censorship of news. "Postcards" only to beused. Friday April 23rd 1915Another fine day - plenty of work [[Ma]]?Physical Drill - and lectures.

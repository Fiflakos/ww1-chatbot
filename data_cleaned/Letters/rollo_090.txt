Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Nationality: Australian Text: through the usual tour. Most of the tombs weresand bagged, most of the important treasures hadbeen removed to safer places - as Zep raids arevery real here.I spent the afternoon about Whitehall - ParliamentHouse, War Office, [[?]], Horse Guards etcThis morning I did the "Tower" enjoying myselfvery much. The "Beefeater" who showed me roundwas very thorough, & my history was well brushedup. This afternoon I intend to go to St. Paul's, -tomorrow visit Wandsworth & Epsom Hospitals asseveral of my boys are there & I must see them.I found out Horseferry Road where Scott is. Iwas pleased to hear he was doing fairly well &I hope to see him personally. I am afraid I must ditch Scotland this trip,time is all too short and there is so much ofinterest to see. As I must be back here by the27th Liverpool & Environs will keep me busy tillthen.I will close now for time being, with veryvery much love, & best of all good wishes fromRollo.

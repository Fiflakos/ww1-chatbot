Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just another short note to letyou know that I am still alright, altho' feeling rather"crummy" at times, & diarehoea has been rather chummiewith me lately, but I am taking Epsom Salts in my tea& am trying to fix it up that way.In your last letter you askedme if I got the parcel of Socks & 2 Handkerchiefs; I thinkI acknowledged them in a previous letter, but if I didn't,then I want to tell you that they came to me quitesafely & I thank you very much for them.I could do with a singlet ortwo, or a sweater for the coming season, but otherwisewe are very well for books & other things like that.I am anxiously waiting forthat little medicine chest that I wrote asking for, itwill be very handy, as one feels quite off colour everynow & then & a little Homoepathic Medecine will makeall the difference in the world.We are still able to go forour daily swim & providing Beachy Bill (a TurksGun who fires on the beach occasionally) does'nt wishus "Good-day", we quite enjoy ourselves. We received some stores from the Canteen Shipyesterday, & it was divided up between the Subsections& I was able to get 5/- worth of various articles suchas, Tinned Sausages, Salmon, Vinegar, Lemonade Powders,Packet Herbs, Candles, Matches, Vaseline, Fancy biscuits, Etc.& we also got an issue of Gift Cigarettes from the VictoriaRacing Club (with love) in addition to our weekly rations,so you see we are alright for a while. But, oh for somefresh green vegetables, we have forgotten the taste of them.I have heard nothing more about my transfer,as I am waiting for the O.C. D.A.Cs reply, but thinkit will not be long now, anyhow I hope not.Mother, will you ask George if he would mindbuying me a pocket flash lamp & a spare battery for it,as it is handy for night firing, & I will settle up withhim when it comes,Well, Mother dear, I think I've finished forthis week so will close: I'll try & write each week, butthere may be difficulties for the conveyance of mails from here.I hope you are all well. Give my kindestregards to all enquirers, my best love to all Relations &all at Home & an extra ration for yourself.Believe meYour loving son.Norman

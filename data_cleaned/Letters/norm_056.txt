Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: No 1 Boyton Camp Codford Wilts England Regiment: 1st Divisional ArtilleryDate: 1 February 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: My Dearest Mother, & all at Home,Just a lineto let you know that my luck has changedagain. Yes! My battery is to be brokenup on arrival in France. All the batteriesare being converted from 4, to 6 gun batteries,& 2 of our guns, with personnel etc, go to the101st How Bty; & the other 2 go to the 102nd How Btyso we spare parts such as Battery Commander;Battery Sergeant Major; & Bty Q.M.S, & Farriers& Fitters & Saddlers, will have to go back toDetails, & goodness only knows if I willever get to the firing line.The other batteriesin this camp meet with a similar fate, sothey're unlucky too. It is rottenluck for me, just as I have a Battery ofmy own, & getting them on so well, too, butI will not relax my efforts to turn themout a smart lot, although there certainlyis no encouragement for me to work & worryto get them into top hole order.To-day, I hadthem all out with guns and wagons & fulldetachments, & they looked fine, (altho' Isay it myself) & it made me feel miserableto think that they were going to be brokenup, and they don't know of this,either, on account of it being a "secret" order Major Harris, (who has just been investedwith the D.S.O) says that he will lookafter me, but I doubt if he can do anygood, as Major Biddle tried hard enoughto get me, & Harris has been before aMedical Board, & is likely to be sent toAustralia as "Unfit", so if it was sohard for me to get out of "Details" as aSergeant, how much more difficulty willit be for me to get out of Details as aB.S.M.?. I really wonderif ever I will have a battery of my own.The men of the battery are nowworking like "Trojans", and even at nighttime, they are to be seen in the Harnessrooms working (on the own account) atcleaning their harness & appointments, &it really is a treat to see them on parade.I do not know what they will saywhen they find out that they are to bedivided up in France, anyhow, myluck is not so good as theirs, as they willgo to a fighting battery but me, & I would not miss the Spring "stunt" forworlds.I received a "Table Talk", & one ortwo newspapers from you this week. Thanks very much, it's great to read abouthome news.I am expecting a letter from Kentto-morrow, containing Australian mail.I do hope you are all well. Give my love toall, & accept the same from.Your loving Son.Norman, 116TH HOWITZER BATTERY1st February 1917.1ST DIVL, ARTILLERY, AUS.No 1 Boyton CampCodford; WiltsEngland

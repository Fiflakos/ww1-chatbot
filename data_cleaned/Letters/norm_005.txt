Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Troopship A 9 Shropshire Near Aden Date: 22 November 1914 Nationality: Australian Text: Sunday 22nd November, 1914.Dear Mother & all at home.I have been wondering how youare all getting on, and I hope for the best. Didyou get my previous letter from Colombo?. Wewere only allowed to write one letter & they censorall our letters before sending. We were not allowedto land there, but by the sight we all sawfrom our anchorage, it is a beautiful place.All the natives in different coloured garbs & Englishpeople in white, & Rickshaws everywhere. All thehouses are without chimneys & they are very large& look like "Paying Guest" houses. Lawns & Palm trees& Cocoa nut trees predominate. Natives in funnyboats made out of a couple of planks came out tous & dive for money, they wont dive for coppersonly silver, but we used to wrap half pennies upin silver paper & throw it in & then to see thefight as they dived for it, & then the bad languageas they discoverd the fraud, they can stay underwater for a very long time. We stayed for 4 daysthere whilst we took in water. Did I describe thefight the Sydney had with the Emden? I think I did.We still have a lot of battleships with us, butthere is no danger now as all the Enemy areGive my kindest regards to Miss Taylor& that I hope she is well are accounted for. The other night, our Japanese warboatsignalled to the cruiser "Melbourne" that these was alight out on the horizon & was going out to see, & altho'the Melbourne was right on the other side of us, she cametearing through between us & the next boat behind us at30 knots an hour & raced the Jap out to it, but therewas nothing doing because they were both back in 10 minutes.Now for the most exciting part of the voyage.Don't be frightened. We have been in a collision withthe Steamer "Ascanius" at 4 o'clock yesterday morningThe Ascanius was sailing 500 yards in rear of us& the boat in front of us stopped & we stopped & signalledto the back boats, but she didn't see our signal & raninto our stern & then up alonside of us & gave us anotherbash in the side. We were all in bed, of course, but I wasawake, & heard our engines stop, & afterwards came the bump.All the horses on deck nearly all fell, & of course we wonderedwhat had happened, & I knew that it wasn't much of a bump,but shortly afterwards the second bash came, & then thealarm bell sounded, I grabbed my life belt & got my pantson & got on deck & there was the Ascanius right alongside &one could have jumped aboard. It is a peculiar feeling becauseone doesn't realise what has happened, & our whistle wasblowing furiously & we were sending up Rockets. Every bodyfell in in their proper positions with life belts on. Then camethe warships tearing down to us at full speed & with theirsearchlights on us & made everything as light as day; Ourdamage was only slight & above the water line so we were able to go on. The Captain was that pleased with ourconduct that he has reported it to the Higher Authorities5 of our boats have left the main division & gone onto Aden at 14 knots per hour, the others are onlydoing 10 knots. We expect to arrive in Southamptonon 18 of December & go into Barracks for 6 months.Everybody is getting sick of the voyage & will beglad to get off the boat as it stinks of Horses. The voyagehas been very calm & very little sickness prevails exceptthrough innoculation which makes one very sick for2 days or more. My mate Saddler Sergeant Jack Hallsays that he wishes he could go into a trance & wakeup when we get to England. Tell Mabel that seavoyages are rotten & I wish I could get my horse ashore& ride overland for the rest of the distance. How is Georgegetting on in his business;? I hope successfully.I hope you are quite well & all at home. How isCharlie & Hettie & family.? Give them my love.Write to Aunt Hannah & tell her my news as Iam not allowed to write more than 2 letters this mail.& please get Jack to write to Winchelsea & tellthem that I am quite well & hope all are well & thatI cannot write at present, but when I get to England I willdo so. & Please write to Constable D Watson of Royal Mint &tell him my news & give him my best wishes & to all the boysthere too. No more news at present so with best Love toall & Rupert also Believe me your loving SonNorman. Tell Jack that thefirst Motor Car I sawin Colombo was a Ford4th letter

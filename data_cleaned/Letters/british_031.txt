Dear Bert, Just a few lines to let you know I am alright, hoping you are the same At the present time we are in dugouts. The weather is simply awful, raining day after day and especially night after nightTo tell you the truth, while writing this letter I am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change. We have got our winter fur coats and gum boots, but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine, for instance last night I was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon, which is number 37. It was pitch dark, no light allowed and in a strange place, well honestly I fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents. On a round of inspection this morning to see if all were comfortable I was blinded up hill and down dale, Sergeant this and Sergeant that. How can you expect men to live in this, and then to put a dampener on the lot, was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night. They took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so, but they could not find me, for the only thing that would shift me, after settling down, if I may call it that, would be a Jack Johnson and then I would have no option. While in the trenches last week John and I were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full. The line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling, but one gets used to it. That, to give you an idea, is like sitting at Paddington and hearing the engines screech. After our stretch this time I shall be looking forward for a short leave for I have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance. Well I must now concludeYours sincerely Jack Symons P.S. Every other home down near the rest camp is anEstaminet (small French caf) where they sell what they call beer, and as much as I like a drop of good beer I have given the stuff out here best for is awful muc.

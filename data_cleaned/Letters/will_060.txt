Author: J W McCay Date: 26 January 1917 Location: London Nationality: British Text: 30 BRUTON STREET,London W.26.1.1917Dear Gen BirdwoodI think it is right to let youknow that today. I sent two cablegramsto Australia, which I reproduce from memorynow.1. Defence Melbourne Medical Boardcertifies me fit Home Service in three weeks, unfitgeneral service for six months. Understandthrough GOC AIF some difficulty aboutemploying me Australia meanwhile. Submitam justly entitled such employment asrecommended by him but prepared serveEngland if necessary though climate adverseto health. Have asked Sir William Irvine tosee you. Gen McCay2. Sir William Irvine Melbourne. Pleasesee cable sent by me on this date to DefenceMelbourne relative to my employmentwhile unfit active service. Gen McCay. You will thus see that I have asked the Dept.in Australia to recognise what I report myselfas an equitable right , the more so as you havespecifically recommended it.If I may, I would like to add that Istill think Australia would be greatlybenefited by having a GOC AIF for Englandunder you & that I humbly believe I coulddo the work & improve the present conditions. I have reason to believe thatthe senior officers here would be pleasedat such an arrangement, except Sir N.Moore, as to whose views I have noknowledge. I am of course the seniorofficer of the Commonwealth Mil Forces serving, &the senior A.I.F. officer, Legge excepted.I therefore hope that if Australia has nosuitable work for me there, you will even nowadvise them to give me charge here. I will riskthe climate - &. if the war lasts to the autumn,hope to take the field again. Kindest regardsYours sincerely, J W McCay

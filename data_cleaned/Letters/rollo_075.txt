Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 9 July 1916 Nationality: AustralianI swapped Hippo for a lighter and better beast - & now havea fine big black mare - a real beauty, & in tip top condition.Herbert and I are getting leave to have a ride round in a dayor two - as my batman (White) reckons she's getting too frisky -no work since Egypt.The Russians seem to be going strong, & the French aredoing pretty well in the Somme - but so far the Tommieshave not done what was expected (Big Push). Later onthe Canadians, & S Africans, & Anzacs will have their turn, &I guess something will shift there. You will have readabout IT in the papers, long before this reaches you.I will close now - much love & good wishes from Rollo.

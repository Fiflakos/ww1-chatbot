Author: James Joseph Makins Location: Somewhere in France Date: 8 July 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother and Father, I do not know whether there is a mail to Australia before next month, but as letters are collected as usual, perhaps it is just as well to write each week. Your letter of 15/5/16 has just come to hand, also a letter and card from Ruby, a card from Auntie Kate, and two letters from Harry. I am still awaiting a letter from Les. I cannot understand why his letters are delayed, as I am sure he is writing each week. I am glad my letters from France reached you alright. I thought you would know I was in France before your received my letter. So far I have received three out of the five parcels you have sent. The two containing socks are still on the way. The only papers to arrive so far are several Age's and Argus's, but I see a good few papers nevertheless. At present we are billeted in a farmhouse, - in the barn attached thereto, I should say. We enjoy a very comfortable bed at present, - plenty of clean straw. The people are very kind and obliging. The farm has the usual thatched roof and is on a typical muddy road of Northern France. The land about here is very fertile and both crops and gardens are looking splendid. The family at present consists of grandmother, father, mother and two grown up daughters. The latter work from morning till night dressmaking. I do not profess to be a judge of sewing &c, but I certainly think their work is most beautiful. Both speak a little English and are anxious to improve themselves, so I seized the opportunity of conversing with them now and then so as to learn more French. They speak and work at high speed (at the same time). I think I am making good headway at French now, under such able tuition. The news of the Combined French and British advance is very satisfactory and the Germans must be feeling the pressure on all the fronts just now. Let us hope they will soon have felt the full weight of England and her hard punch. There is very little news to tell you this time, so I must adjourn till next week. Your affectionate son, Jim P.S. I am sending some PIC's to Perce, Ruby and Gertie.

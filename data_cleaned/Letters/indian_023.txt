From Mithan Lal, Storekeeper, Convalescent Home, New Milton, to Maulvi Abdul Jabar Sahib, Ballygunj, Calcutta. (Urdu, 2/12/15). Alas, we are not free to go about at will. In fact we Indians are treated like prisoners. On all sides there is barbed wire and sentry stands at each door, who prevents us from going out. In cases of urgent necessity, when the C.O. is satisfied that urgency exists, leave or absence from three hours is obtained with great difficulty. Leave London out of the question; we cannot even get to see New Milton properly although London and Southampton are not more than three or four hours journey by rail. If I had known that such a state of affairs would exist, I would never have come. In India we were assured that once our work for the day was finished, we would be free to go where we pleased. We were led to believe that the daily work of storekeeper would not take up more than three hours a day, and that having finished our work, we might wander where we pleased. If you ask me the truth, I can say that I have never experienced such hardship in all my life. True, we are well fed, and are given plenty of clothing; but the essential thing freedom is denied. Convicts in India are sent to Andaman Islands; but we have found our convict station here in England. You no doubt think that I am enjoying myself to the full, and making distant pleasure trips; but as a matter of fact our existence here is as monotonous as that of a simple rustic. We have to put up with the treatment accorded to us by the sepoys, and you know what highhanded people they are. In fact I cannot describe to you the troubles we experience. I will wait till I can do so by word of mouth. (Letter passed)

We landedunder the fire of our battleships &altho' there was plenty of shrapnel alongthe beach, we managed to get "A" Subsgun into a high position on a hill &he we at once got to work & located aTurkish battery (6 Guns) & we gavethem a taste of direct fire & put themcompletely out of action in 18 shots This battery had been shelling thelanding parties along the beach &were very annoying & the battleshipscould not locate it & it was not untilwe were firing in a different directionthat we discovered we were gettingit from them & our Major suddenlylocated them & turned us on them.Our Infantry got a terrible timeuntil we arrived & were being killed& wounded by the scores by the Turksshrapnel & I am glad to say thatour arrival put fresh heart intothem. We were the only Gun inTurkish territory for 24 hours & wewere under fire from 3 different directions & the snipers are the worst ofthe lot, but we are quite safe & don't mind the shrapnel a bit. Wehave had only 2 wounded in mySub, Powell, the Range finder, got hitby a spent bullet & was a littlestunned. Jack Heywood was makingsome tea & a bullet grazed his hand,but he was most unconcerned aboutit & went on making the tea after hehad made a few uncomplimentaryremarks about them. I must saythat the behaviour of my boys ismarvellous, they go about whilstbullets are flying in all directions &take not the Slightest heed of them.Ammunition is plentiful & we fireabout 300 to 400 rounds per day.We are all mixed up as batteries& I am right away from the other guns of our battery. Moons gun isabout 3 miles from us attached tothe 3rd Brigade, & I am with anothergun of the 5th Battery. Colonel Johnstongot hit in the leg whilst washing &our Dr got it in his "sitting down"place, washing. The warships aredoing great work & are shellingcontinuously & the "Queen Elizabeth"with her 15 inch guns, shakes thewhole place when she fires & the noiseis deafening, but we like her music.Our horses are still on the boat &are not likely to land for some time.The Indian Mountain Batteries aredoing good work & their mules carryenormous loads up the steepest hillswithout much effort. The British division landed at the foot of the peninsular& we landed half way up, so youcan see that our job was by farthe hardest, but we are holding themsafe & are well "dug in" & there istons of barbed wire in front of ourtrenches. We are under fire allday & all night, but we all sleepwell as it nearly all falls intothe sea. We are very comfortable &have good tucker, etc & the healthof all is splendid & I have neverfelt better in my life. We allassembled in Lemnos & after aweeks stay, sailed for here & at daybreak, the battleships were pouringin broadsides & it was a sightI'll never forget. Aeroplanes & seaplanes were flying all over theplace & we could here the Turksmachine guns trying to bringthem down, but to no avail.We go down to the beach fora swim in the afternoon, soyou see, this isn't too bad, eh.I intend to give this letter toanybody going back to the boat& one of the crew will post it,otherwise it will be censored.It is great to see the warboats standing off & firingover our heads. Truly theBritish Navy is wonderful.The Queen "Lizzie" got onto theTurks-German Armoured train &blew it sky high with her 15 inchguns. Men, guns & train was scattered inall directions. They had beendoing a lot of destructive work.The weather here is delightful& we have had only one littleshower for about 3 minutes sincewe arrived.At the present minute, 4 warships are firing right over ourheads to the forts on the otherside of the Pen^insular, They are theTriumph, Prince of Wales, Queen;& "Buccaneer" & the noise isdeafening. That is the advantageto us of the place being only 5miles wide. We expect to behere for a week until the otherdivision drive up the Turks from down below, then wepress them into a position &blow them to "blazes".Now Mother, dear, don't bealarmed for us, as we are ina strong winning position, &altho' the Infantry have losta lot, there are no casualtieswhatever with the Artillery, &the Turks are retreating every-where. I hope all are wellGive my love to everybody &don't forget our "dinner".With fondest loveI amYour loving sonNorman My boys chalk on each of our shells"with complements from 'A ' Sub 4th Bty.& all our names

Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 12 April 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Camp Heliopolis Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: W. Evans9th LH Regiment.12. 4. 1916 My dear mother,Since I last wrote youa mail has come to hand with a letterfrom you & Mrs Bloomfield & Dr Rennie.I am very glad that you receivedthe things safely & liked them - when Igo to Cairo next time I shall sendalong some more. I had originallyintended the small vases for you butyou do as you please. I had also aanother shawl of the same kind as I sentyou but found it had a flaw in it & wasnot able to procure another like it inCairo. You ask where the troops fromAnzac are - well my dear, that isjust what I can't tell you. I ama little short of writing paper at present& am using old stuff as we had aterrific windstorm the other night& my tent blew down as the pegs don'thold well in this sand & when Icame to gather my things together I couldn't find the pad & also a letterI had just written. You would havelaughed to see me with my batman &groom gathering up my belongings inthe moonlight in the midst of a howlingwind & flitting away with them to my newhumpy which fortunately was just completed.Half the tents in the camp came down &it was a funny spectacle & then when someof the boys put them up again they blewdown in the middle of the night. I hada further experience since then, as yesterdayI rode down to a post some fourmiles away & on the return journeythe wind which had in the morningbeen rather brisk freshened to a gale& we were unable to see a hundredyards in front of us. It was frightfullyunpleasant riding through this rsandstorm or khamseen as it is calledas the loose sand rises in clouds &flings itself on the unfortunate rider.Fortunately I was wearing goggles& they protected my eyes. We camealong well for a while passed one ofour posts & turned over a sandridgewe knew well & made for our camp.However it was not so simple as it seemed because the country here ispractically all alike & the sunwas almost obliterated th we coulddistinguish no landmarks. Also thisis a new camp to me & hard tofind, so after a while we thoughtwe were there & found we weren't,so we turned & went to the top of asandridge but could see nothing.I was accompanied by one ofthe medical orderlies & decidedthat the wisest thing to do wasto stay where we were until thestorm cleared a little. So down wesat & held our horses & spenta most unpleasant hour. Thesand poured over us like a showerbath continuously & our poor horsesstood like two statues the very pictureof misery. However we told sometales & cracked a few jokes &after a while we saw two men walking& a man riding & waved butthey did not see us. We soonsaw however that they alsowere lost & we had great sport watching their movements & today Iwas talking to an officer in the nextregiment named Bucklan whowent to school at CooerwullAcademy & on comparing notes foundit was as he. We knew we were not farfrom camp as we had only riddenabout 20 minutes from the last spotwe had recognised. After we had waitedfor about an hour during which the sandcontinued to be driven by the wind withgreat intensity, it moderated slightly & Icaught sight of some abandonedhumpies about half a mile away whichI thought I recognised & we rodeover to them & found we were right &then set off again & this timefound our way safely to camp.A good number of others had difficultyalso & some of them spent thenight out & came in today as thewind has now subsided a good deal.In future when the wind is strong I intendstaying at home. I wrote last to you when in Cairo &forget just what I told you. DidI tell you that I paid a visitto Harold Thomas of Manly whois in a British General Hospitalin Cairo? He went home & joined thereThere was an opening of a tennis courtat the Hospital that day & I tried toplay tennis but was a lamentablefailure as I was so completely outof practice. Thomas looks well& was very glad to see me. Ithink I told you that our Churchof England padr was stayingat the same hotel & we went tothe "Kinsaal" together. It is akind of variety show somethinglike the Tivoli in Sydney & is practicallythe only place of the kind in Cairo.We enjoyed the first part butgrew sleepy later as it did notcommence till 9.30p.m. & weleft before the end. I cameback by train & arrived at mystop at 10.30p.m. where a manwas waiting with the horses & I spent the night with one of ourofficers who is camped nearthere, slept beautifully on the floorcame on here next day.My humpy is a regular da/isyTwo large windows covered withhessian to keep out flies & sand &good door on manufactured hinges,the whole lined with the straw matsso common in this country. Buta visitor has just droppedin so must concludewith best of lovefromYour loving son,Wilf.

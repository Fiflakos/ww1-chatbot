I havejust returned from 4 days leave in Londonwhich I spent with May Tilton.I had somedifficulty in getting away from camp thro'being in Isolation for being a contact ofa case of Meningitis, developed by a sergeantin the 117th Battery who slept in the samehut as myself, & of course we were all putin strict isolation.The Dr was very consideratefor me however, & sent me in on horsebackto Sutton Veny Hospital to have a "swab"of my throat taken by the patheologist, &this was put in an incubator for 24 hours,& at the end of that time it proved "negative"& I was allowed to proceed on Leave.I caughta train from Codford at ten minutes past oneon Monday, & on arrival at Salisbury, therewas a fast train for Waterloo in ten minutes& this got me into London by 3-15 p.m.Altho' thedistance is 85 miles, the train did not stopbetween Salisbury & Waterloo, & she travelsat about 65 miles per hour, so we havesomething to catch up in Railway servicesin Melbourne, eh?I was to have met May atEuston at 2.30pm, but this was out of reason, however I had sent her a telegram tothis effect, & she went to her hotel.On myarrival, I went to the Strand Palace Hotelbut May had gone to a Theatre with someother Nurses, so I left a note, & returned inthe morning at 10-30, & met her waiting for me.She looked fine , Never better, & not a day older than when I last sawher, & as jolly as ever, too.We went downto dinner, after a long chat, & then wewent to a matinee. Home again for Tea,& out to a Theatre afterwards.We flew abouteverywhere, & talk about taxis, wellwe were in 3 different taxis in 10 minutes.That is the honest truth.Next day, I wentshopping in Regent St, & Oxford St withMay & another nurse, & of course took meinto all the ladies underclothing Depts, &I felt awfully embarrased, & imaginedthat every girl in "Selfridges" in Oxford St(one of the largest firms in London) was lookingat me, however, I came thro' theordeal well, loaded up with parcels etc,& thrust into a taxi, & back again to theStrand.In the evening, I met Lucy Cole,& brought her along & introduced her to May,& we had a mighty feed, & off to a theatrein another Taxi.May & Lucy took very well to each other, or at least I thought so,& they each in turn told me that theyliked each other.After the theatre,camesupper, & then I got Lucy off Home, &when I returned to my Hotel, I countedmy money, & I found I had exactly10d left, out of 4., but May came tothe rescue with 3 & off we started again.Next morning, we both went to theA.I.F Headquarters in Horseferry Rd, &transacted some business, & then taxiedback to dinner, & in the afternoon wesat & talked until it was time for us toreturn to our respective stations, thereto catch the train back to our quarters.Itwas a jolly fine little holiday, & I wasvery pleased to have met May, & the nexttime I meet her, I hope to have morecash, as London just eats .I wassorry that Jack could not get over fromFrance, but Gallipoli men come firstfor leave, & Jack missed that stunt.Lucy Cole has just got a job atthe war office & was starting nextFriday. She had to pass thro' atest of shorthand & Typewriting, & thisshe easily succeeded in doing, as sheis well up in this work, having hadprevious experience.Lucy told me thatHarriet was in bed with Influenza, but was well over it now.Lucy also told me thatthere were 2 letters at Gravesend, also a paperfrom Australia, but the parcel has notturned up to date yet.May Tilton told methat she had nursed Geo Johnson in Hosplin Egypt, but she could not make out whathe was in there for.We are very busy nowas there are horses coming in each day, &we are hard at work breaking them in.There are some very good horses amongthem, but most are out of veterinary Depots.The riding horses are out of the ReserveCavalry Brigade, & there are some finehacks amongst them. I picked afine "tat" for myself, & he will carrymy weight very well.We are having agood deal of trouble with men breakingcamp, & absent without leave, & the Majorhas been obliged to award 28 detention& cells to the culprits, in order to stopit. Men get their parents to send themmoney from Australia, & then they clearout until it is spent. We have tostop it some where.Well! I hope you areall well at Home. Give my love to all,I am in the best of health, Thanks!Much love fromYour loving Son,Norman. 116TH HOWITZER BATTERY12 January 1917.1ST DIVL, ARTILLERY, AUS.No 1 Boyton Camp, CodfordWilts; England

The bombs, & star shells are alsointeresting too watch from a distance: & we canhear the noises of engagements from various posts, bothfar & near:As we shall be getting some cold weather heresoon, we have to dig well into the hill for our'dugouts' but we hope to get to Constantinople forthe winter! - Anything you would like from there?it is noted for its 'harems' but whatever they are, somay bring one of them back with me.Hope you are well.Love to all,Will.

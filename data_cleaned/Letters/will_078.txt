Author: Hedworth Meux Date: 29 March 1917 Nationality: British Text: 4, AUDLEY SQUARE,W.GERRARD 5365.March 29th, 1917.My dear General.It was exceedingly nice of you writingto me about my speech aboutKitchener and I immenselyappreciated it.My reference to his share inyour most successful & wonderfulevacuation of Gallipoli wasclumsily worded but I do notimagine anyone could reallybelieve I meant to detract from your glory in that extraordinaryachievement & I should imaginethat the letter signed "Anzac"was probably written in theEditor's room.I am glad that I should havebeen the first to publiclyprotest against the foulattacks on K's reputation.It was at the bombardmentof Alexandria that I firstmet K in 1882 & subsequentlywas at Suakin 1886-1887with him as senior navalofficer in the Red Sea whilsthe was Governor & we had been great friends ever since.But your long association withhim was of course muchgreater & more intimate thanmine & I can understandyour feelings about him.What a wonderful time youmust be having now inFrance - always doing somethingwhilst we in Englandhave to sit xx impotentlyreading about their the German atrocities ashore & afloat.I quite agree with your remarksabout these commissions - Inever wanted them but ifthey had them I wasdetermined they should havea soldier & sailor asmembers of the commission.Spring has not yet quitearrived but it is strugglinghard to conquer the harddying winter.With sincerest regardsYours,Hedworth MeuxWhen next you come over do let meknow

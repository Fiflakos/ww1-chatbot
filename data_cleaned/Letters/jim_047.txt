Author: James Joseph MakinDate: 23 July 1916Nationality: Australian Text: Date: 23rd July 1916. I have not had any chance of posting this letter, so I am finishing it now for tonight's mail. I have just come from Benediction in the old village church, and I learnt that letters have to be handed in by 10 o'clock. We have had several days' spell in this place, which by the way, is our last stopping place before reaching our 'objective,' - a line of trench in the vicinity of the 'big push'. You can imagine with what feelings we await our entry into the scene of operations, naturally, we are all anxious to "get busy" right away, and any delay keeps tension on ones nerves. I daresay you get just as much information, perhaps more than we do about things, so I shall not lose any time on discussing the situation. Whatever comes, I feel confident and happy. It is a fine thing to feel physically and spiritually fit for anything, and that is just how I feel tonight. The only thing that I am worrying.

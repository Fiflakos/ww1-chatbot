Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: FranceDate: 2 March 1917 Nationality: Australian Text:Dear Father & Mother,-I recd your cable yesterday telling me thatGeorge had just left A, & was due to arrive in Eng.about the end of March. I am afraid my chance ofmeeting him is very remote, as by that time wewill be in front again - and perhaps pushing outwell beyond Bapaume &there'll be no chance ofSpec. Leave. I've already sent in an applicationto H.Q. &if I get it now I'll be coming back beforeG. can be anywhere near England so my luckis out this time.Today I recd your letter of 8.1.17 - the onlymail since 20.12.16 - &the first news from [[Wrimps]]& Mum since 13.12.16. I think some mail hasgone astray - anyhow what is wrong with George.I know he got a knock on the jaw (which broke)while boxing - & then in a subsequent letter you mentioned the injury to his eye would probablyprevent him sailing on the Omrah - (Jan 5th) &from then to end of Feb. is a rather long time tobe delayed on a/c of his eye. What was wrong?As he has sailed I suppose its O.K. again butin future let me know right away as soon asanything goes wrong?Fritz is slowly falling back, &our boys are helping him along a little quicker than he likes aswe have about 7 miles of front to look after.If Fritz stands at Bapaume you will probablyfind our Divy helping him out of it. Bapaumewould be a nice stunt - guess there'll be somethingdown there during the next fortnight, & I dontthink we'll be far away.45 days we worried him &then we were relieved.It was the 49th night that he cleared out, soyou can imagine how annoying it was to be onour way back here while Fritz was [["sloping"]].Our Div. worried him a lot in the [[Gondecourt]]area.I was glad to hear of your Xmas at Unley -hope I'll be with you at the next one.Lance Cpl Scott has managed to be sent back to A.Fritz tried to make a sieve of him - but I hopehe is not incapacitated - as he was a splendidman - gave up a farm near Gladstone - but Ithink his people live in N. Unley.Don't worry about Fritz & his TANKS - we arenot afraid of anything pertaining to him, &so farwe have circumvented &even bettered his besttricks - &now he's feeling the stress extremely.It's over a year since the 50th was formed, &arenearly all are still going strong in various ways [[Loutit]] is Major now - Fowler, Moule, Wilton,Seager, Smith - (Jacob (Lt. Col & O.C H) &myselfare all going strong - Herbert & Hancock arewith the [[Trng.]] Battn. &[[Dinden]] is still a memoryto us of a gallant gentleman. I intend toride across to [[Warloi]] on Sunday to see hisgrave. The only French friends I have madeare looking after it.Perhaps [[Wumps}} would like to write to oneof them - (age 18) - if she writes simple &clearEnglish &mentions she is my sister - I amsure she will get an amusing replyMlle Melitia CarneyWarloy BaillonSommeFranceNews is uncertain - I can only say definitelythat we are winning nowI'll close with my very very best of allgood wishes to you all for prosperity, success,good health, &all sorts of good luck - withmuch love to yourselves fromYr loving sonRollo.Letter to Harry same date

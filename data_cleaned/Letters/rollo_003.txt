However I'telepathed' birthday greetings to you yesterday& again today. I have telepathed greetings to youall. For the five will be at home today as Ibelieve. Wumps won't leave till the 24th.I'm sending a mixed assortment this mail filmsviews about the Pyramids - Kasr El Nil Bridge(compare size of cart or 'gharry' with lions -theyare immense) and one of myself on a camel - takenby a "gippy" guide - & which is almost unrecognisablewhen printed. Two other views don't print well -one of Mooski St. (where I bt. those presents).I stood on the top of the garry to take it - and Iam sorry it does not turn out better. Anotherone I took to show the size of the granite blocksin the Temple of the Sphinx - but no luck. Ihave a good silhouette of the Sphinx - showingher minus her nose - I believe that is also withthe lot.I can't say too much re news - it may be2 or 3 weeks before you hear again - as we aregoing well out into the desert - about 14 miles theother side of the Canal. Water & transport will beour difficulties, but as we are 'front line' we ought. Rollo.

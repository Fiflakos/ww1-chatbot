So you are going to have a (pigeon) kill off to reduce numbers, well, theyll come in handy for the homing pigeon fund, that is if you dont want them for yourselves. Dad has had my place lime-washed out, he says it looks quite smart again. I think there are only four old birds and two youngsters there now. The bombs from the Zeps (Zeppelins) shook you up then, they make a nice little row dont they. I have heard them out here and seen them drop, and a piece of one of the bombs hit me and I was quite 500 yards from where it dropped, of course it did not hurt me, as it was spent. Even the noise from those bombs is not a quarter as loud as one I had drop near me last Saturday, it was a trench mortar bomb and although I was quite 50 yards from it the force of the explosion knocked me over. Yours very sincerely Ron Newspaper cutting Dyer, Private R.A.W. (14833) 2ndBattalion Bedfordshire Regiment, attached to Signal Company, 47thDivision, British Expeditionary Force.

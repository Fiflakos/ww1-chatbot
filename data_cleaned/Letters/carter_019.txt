Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Date: 11 May 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: May 11, 1915.My dear Father & Mother- I had a nasty jar yesterday when Iheard that Teddy Townshend had been killed. He wasabout the best friend I had in the force.I find myself dreaming a lot at night now & all on themost calm & peaceful subjects. I feel most annoyedwhen waking to hear the rattle of musketry & roarof guns. I had a decent wash this afternoon

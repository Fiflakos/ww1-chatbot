Author: Unknown. Date: 16 September 1915. Text:I don't wonder Mater that you were soupset when you heard of DouglasLennard's death. He was an exceptionallynice fellow & a general favorite inthe Battery. The incidents connectedwith his death were printed in theWest Australian & were remarkablecorrect in every detail - even the wordsspoken were correct. The official reportdidn't do justice to the case - it juststated the bare facts without givingany details - which would makesplendid reading - for we all love toread heroic acts & there wouldbe nothing more heroic than Doug'sdeath. The dear fellow! Now he isbeside seven of his comrades on ourown Battery graveyard. We have put an inscribed cross at his head& covered the mound with brassfuse caps. It is a grave worthy ofthe hero that lies at rest in it. Extract from a fellow Battery pals

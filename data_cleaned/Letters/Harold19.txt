Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 22 June 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: I am by no means a hero. I don't mind admitting I dread these beggars. I have seen the effect of them - they're about the limit. They [[?]] about 6' or 9' with the ground - & blow out a hole to that depth and about same diameter. I have seen the damage that 20 of these did to some trenches - 150 men took 4 hours to repair them next night. They can be dodged with luck - but without luck - !! However where they use these fakes, we reply with "pudding" bombs. A pudding for a family of no [[?]] their size - so you can guess Fritz doesnt [["stomach"]] them much. Fritz is a shrewd Enemy, uses all sorts of tricks, but as you know we don't use our brains at all, so they do as they like - I don't think!! I could tell you a few tit bits concerning the [[?hobby?]]. I am now - busy with- but of course I must obey the Censor's rules. Fritz is shrewd & clever;- they have taught us much, and I really believe we will be excellent pupils. Birdwood inspected us yesterday & told us we would have "plenty of "it" directly" so we are expecting a journey over the [[?top]] soon. I have put my name for "Blighty leave" well down on the list - altho' its really due this week - but having brought the boys so far. I think it my duty to take them [[?into]] Fritz territory. We are exceedingly busy night & day, so I am tired now - but will write later. But of all good luck, success, happiness, much love, hopes you are as well as Your loving [[?Rollo]]

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Somewhere in FranceDate: 28 October 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Father & Mother,The mail closes tomorrow but I willwrite a few lines now. I put in for a job as a Staff Capton a Bg. Staff - but no luck - my chance may come laterSince my last I've had a big job (Staff - it was too) inentraining our whole Divy. away from Belgium to thisplace. - It took 23 hours of continuous, strenuous work -but I got every man, horse, vehicle, &c., away well up totime. I came under notice of the Divn. Staff - so I nowhave a "leg in" for something. else later on.C. Co. doesn't seem the same. Beresford has been sent toEng. to our Tng Bn with Major Herbert for 6 mos. Imade 'Beresford' an officer, same way as Giles did me.He fought alongside of me, & was a fine young chap, soI am very sorry to lose him - as he was reliable too.I couldn't part with Jim without feeling it very much,for a better man doesn't exist. I have now no 'crony'of my own or superior rank - & the Bn seems strange.However we have to put up with it now - tho' itseems strange without Jim on parade.Well we are "near it again" - so no more news for awhile,& I'll close with much love & kindest regards to all especiallyyourselves Your loving sonRollo.Hope you're as well as I am.

Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 4 February 1917 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 4.2.1917My dear mother,After writing my last letter & telling you Ihad received one letter, the other came along a couple ofdays later being registered. I hardly think it isnecessary to put on the extra twopence my dear, the mailis very good just at present. I think I forgotto tell you that, when in Cairo, I sent a chequeof 50 to the Commercial Bank in Candelo throughthe Sydney head office, as the Anglo-Egyptian bankin Cairo told me that was the safest & cheapestcourse, & I enclosed a note asking them to give youcomplete control over it as over the rest, so you pleasedo just what you think best. It had been accumulatingin my pay book from before Gallipoli as while therewe couldn't spend anything & while in the desertwe don't spend much except when we go to Cairo &then it is awkward getting money just at the right timebut I have avoided that now oy putting some in thebank. I have "Ginger Mick" as Harry sent it alongto me but it was very kind of Dr Sharp to send italong, I must write & thank him. Just at present weare very well off in deed for reading matter as we haveall been to Cairo & bought books back with us &we have just received some books from theRed Cross in addition. However we will movewhen the time comes, with the stuff we are accumulatinghere now, heaven knows, but there will be agood deal of sweating done by myself to try & getthe load on the camels - note that we are likelyto move just now as far as we can see-still one never knows. I have been away againthis week only to Kantarah this time (look it upon your map my dear) & had just a flying tripthere & back on duty. I can't tell you whatthe duties were as that would be giving awaystate secrets. However it took me a day trottinground. I left here one morning at about 7.30a.m. per hospital train & had quite a longtrip as the wind was blowing very fiercely &raising clouds of sand with it so that inplaces where the line runs between smallcuttings the sand obstructed the line &we had to stop & dig an a way for ourselvesthrough it in some places & to makematters worse our old engine went bung& we had to send for another, so thatit was late at night when we arrived at ourdestination. Capt Yuille who is from thisAmbulance & was going on leave to Cairo accompaniedme & I was glad of his company. We weretreated well on the train & managed to getsome nourishment on board & in the evening wechummed up with a Scotch officer who wasa patient going down to have his appendixremoved & another doc. & played bridgefor 3 or 4 hours & this kept us amusedso that we did not notice time passing. Whenwe arrived we set out looking for a home forthe night, walked a couple of miles & got aboat over the canal & directed our steps toa small camp which has been established bya Mrs Chisholm for the convenience of officers& men travelling up & down from Cairo. Trainsarrive at all hours of the night & very often infact almost invariably those coming from thisside do not fit in with those leaving on the otherside of the canal which are part of the EgyptianState Railways & men who have gone down fromhere, sometimes spending nearly 24 hours on the trainswithout being able to get food or drink, wouldhave to spend the night out in the open but for such an institution. So that it is reallya noble work they are doing. They supplymeals & good ones too at a nominal cost,& bl beds blankets etc. The YMCA &Church Army also have similar institutionssomewhere in Kantarah but not run byAustralians & of course we always makefor our own if possible. Mrs Chisholm isa small delicate looking oldish lady &is assisted by a Miss McPhillamy awell known name in N S Wales I think &they both look quite tired out, as theyhave had a rush lately & the night wearrived all the beds were full, but wewere given a couple of mat blankets &were quite happy to doss on the floorofthe tent with over coats as pillows. I wasoccupied all next day with my work &returned the same night by hospital train& had a beautiful sleep all night in acomfy bunk with sheets & blankets,waking up this morning when we arrivedhere. I had breakfast with our Immobile Section who are situated near the station.Hearing that there were some Ambulanceswhich belonged to our worthy cousins divisionnear by I trotted off to see him as I havebeen expecting him up here for some time &have been keeping an eye open. Sure enoughhe was there & wanted to know all aboutRafa & Magdaba, asked after you & soon. He looks very well & seems to like theplace out here, it certainly is much morepleasant than the desert where no water isto be seen. Now I am back again & allis well, have been fairly busy today straighteningthings out one way & another & now think Iwill turn in to bed, smoke a pipe & reada novel very contentedly. It's beautifulto go to bed when it's a little chilly & smoke& read, one feels quite a philosopher thenlike Diogenes again. A Life came safelyto hand & some Sydney Mails from Em lastmail thankyou all very much,with love to all the old family & anextra share for mother fromHer loving son,Wilf.

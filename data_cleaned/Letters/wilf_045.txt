Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 11 May 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Camp Heliopolis Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 11th 5. 1916My dear mother,Here we are again in the samespot writing in the same old way. I receivedone of your letters again this week & am glad tosay that mail is coming fairly regularly now.Nothing has happened at all since I last wroteso that my letter will again be uninteresting.Wesley & I went into the xxx (I forgot & almostput something censorable), at any rate we wentin & had a dip one day this week, you willprobably guess where. It was exceedingly enjoyeableas the weather is warm & the water delightful &we splashed & floated & swam to our hearts'content. We then called on Roy Winn (one ofthe Newcastle Winns) who is a medico in abattalion near there & dined with him met quitea lot of fellows & rode home in the moonlightafterwards. Of course I had to stop with Wesleyfor a while & have a corroboree for a few minutesat his camp before coming on. The nextday Winn & another fellow came along &had lunch with Wesley & visited me later in the afternoon. Beyond that I havepractically done nothing beside my duties hereall week & the chief trouble is the monotony.I have very little to do & sometimes it is difficultto fill in the time but still it passes away & theend of the war grows nearer. Wesley cameout to dinner tonight & has just left & thenJaques came along & had a yarn & smoke.I rose at 3.30 a.m. this morning & am feelingrather weary but that was an exceptionalpractice for me & at any rate I'm going todoss early though I had an hour thisafternoon. Nothing further to tell you mydear - I do hope you are keeping brisk &well so that you will be in good health& spirits when I return. Best of loveto all & an extra lot for mother fromHer loving son (who is sleepy),Wilf.

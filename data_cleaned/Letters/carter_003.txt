We provided 5 turkeys & a keg of beerfor our Company. - - Part of the morning I spentin ascending the Great Pyramid My knees were shakingwhen we got back from the strain. &c &c.we have been spending the past couple of days inmaking the camp tidy All my company lines arenow marked out in white stones on the sand & severalof the tents have made weird devices & designs of the samein front of their tents. They have been much admired bysome of the other companies.I attended Divine Service this morning - the Dean officiated.The parsons complain of not being able to get hold ofthe men & when they get a chance, as today withabout 2500 or 3000 men they seem to do their bestto make as dull a show as possible. The men canbarely hear, others have to stand the whole time inthe blazing sun. The soldiers spend theirmoney freely - & as the pay bill must beabout 100,000 per week you can realize therecord season -H.G. Carter

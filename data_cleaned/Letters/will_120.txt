They took Masnireson Nov 20 & held the line into Dec 3when the remnant was relieved. -They are 240 bayonets now.I write only to wish you goodluck & to express my belief that youhave not only the qualities of a soldierbut the infinite tact required to makethe most and bring out the best in theAustralian army. - I still back myoriginal prophecy. Yours very truly,W.E.Davidson

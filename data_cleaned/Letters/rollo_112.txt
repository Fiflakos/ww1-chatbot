Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: FranceDate: 23 March 1917 Nationality: Australian Text:Dear Father & Mother,- Just a short note on the eve of going a little furtherforward - to say things are going well - weather isimproving, men are very fit, unit up to strength, andeveryone has got his punch,- tails well up, chins wellout, noses up - etc, etc, in fact we are not onlylike Johnny Walker but also Viceroy tea.Fritz has gone well back but somehow I don'tthink they'll go very far - as they are now almostin the Hindenburg Line.This Line is a beauty from what we hear - anyhow Iwouldn't mind having a look at it. Our aeroplanetrip was knocked on the head on account of weather,however it has been promised to us when next wecome out of the line.Only last night I received your Plum Pudding. It wasintact, but the tin was battered out of recognition. Wegot it out without breaking it, managed to boil it, & atdinner today it was splendid, and everyone was delightedWe didn't find the lucky button, & we will come on it & thecoins in the second half. Anyhow I am glad it came tohand - I had almost posted it as gone.I went to Albert today - the inhabitants are slowly coming backlast August there were no civilians there - now they areflocking back. This must be a very brief note - plenty ofwork ahead, no news. We are 2 days behind the newspapersso you may guess where we are.I will write again as soon as possible; & will now close withVery very much love, & best of all good wishes for all sorts ofgood luck & hope you are as well as Your loving son, Rollo.

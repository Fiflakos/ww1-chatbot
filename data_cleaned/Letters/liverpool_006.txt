Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: Lord William Birdwood Date: 7 June 1917 Nationality: New Zealand Text: Dear Sir William Birdwood,1. I want first of all to convey to youmy best congratulations on the Honour which His Majestythe King has conferred upon you on the occasion of hisBirthday.2. Knowing the interest which youtake in everything concerning New Zealanders, and also forobvious reasons which I shall give, I want to tell you thatthere is considerable annoyance here over the raising of theadditional Fourth Brigade, a step which my Ministers neverapproved of, although under certain stipulations they allowedit to be formed, the most stringent stipulation being thatthis Government would not provide any reinforcements for theBrigade, and that the reinforcements for the New ZealandDivision must not be depleted. The position now is, that ifany reinforcements are required for the New Zealand Divisionover and above what are being now sent, the Brigade has got tobe disbanded, the reason being that the New Zealand Governmentare determined to carry out the obligations which they imposedupon themselves and which represent the maximum which theyconsider they can do : they will run no risk of failing.I tell you all this because there is a strong feeling amongstall classes in New Zealand that Godley is responsible forhaving let this Government in to acquiescing in the raisingof the Fourth Brigade, and although this has been repudiatednothing that anyone can say will convince the people thatsuch is not the case. Godley is more unpopular now than he has ever been before, and the question may possiblybe raised in Parliament to get the New Zealand Troops putunder your Command, as both soldiers and civilians alikeare most anxious that this shall be done. It is for thisreason that I thought it right to tell you quite privatelyabout the matter : the question may indeed crop up beforethis letter reaches you.With every good wish, Believe me,Yours sincerely,Liverpool GOVERNMENT HOUSE DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON, SECRET AND PERSONAL.

General. HospitalGheyireh Palace, Cairo.26. 01. 1916. My dear Miss Champion,I do remember Private Tom Whyte very well. Thepoor man came on the Gaseonduring the morning. He had anabdominal wound, and wastaken to the operation room almostat once. and every thing possiblewas done for him. He was veryanxious that a packet should be given to a friend of his. whosename I have unfortunately forgotten.Late that night I went to the poorman and stayed with him tilhe died - Really I don't think hesuffered very much pain, but wasglad to have some woman there,he died between 12 m.n. and 1 a.m.I was with him at the time & forsome time before. The only thing hewas worried over was some packagebeing delivered to his friend, & I'mfairly certain it was sent. The Colonel was very good &did his best to carry out suchrequests. I feel certain that theremust have been some messagefor you in it. He was a braveman and died as a man ought.I'm more sorry for you than I cantell you - and it was knowinghe was engaged made me stay onduty a little longer. to be whatcomfort I could to him. It wasa terrible day for us alland I saw so much that was awful that Day. I'm sorryI can't tell you more poor girl, butI would be only too thankful toanswer any questions. The packagewas sewn up. and he did notas far as I know see any Photographbut I'm sure it was what he wasso anxious about. You may resthe did not suffer very long andwas not disfigured in any way.and I was with him to the very lastI wish I could tell you more poorgirl.Yours sincerelyKatherine M. Porter

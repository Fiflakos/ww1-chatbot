Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: Lord William Birdwood Date: 2 August 1916 Nationality: New Zealand Text: Dear Sir William Birdwood,I thought I would like to let you know privately of a matter which has been brought to my notice confidentially.The New Zealand Government have for a considerabletime felt very strongly regarding the position of thoseofficers, both Imperial and New Zealand, who have been carryingout so efficiently the training of the various Reinforcements.The Government of this Dominion have considered it their dutyto retain the services of these officers in New Zealand inorder that the drafts may reach the highest possible efficiencyin training. They have also considered most carefully thepossibility of employing officers who have already been abroadand who are no longer fit for active service, but they recognisethat the work would be beyond the capabilities of such menas a great strain is being put upon all engaged in that work.In passing, I may remark that all these officershave been most anxious to go out themselves, and it has beenmost difficult to persuade them to recognise the fact that thework which they are doing here is invaluable to the troops atthe front. Such being the case, the New Zealand Government are determined that their services shall not remainunrecognised and so become "out of sight, out of mind".I am very pleased to say that in the case of the Commandant,Brigadier-General Sir Alfred Robin, and the Chief of theGeneral Staff, Colonel C. M. Gibbon, their services wererecognised at the King's last Birthday ; but the reason thatI am writing to you is that apparently Sir Alexander Godleytakes a totally different view. He has written conveying theimpression that no-one who has not seen active service canexpect rewards, and while I should not like this letter quoted,I felt that it was only right to inform you that these ideasof his have not been favourably viewed here, more especiallyas they come from a man who has received a good many "plums"inside of two years. I have never mentioned a word toyou before, but I cannot disguise the fact that General Godleyis looked upon as a somewhat selfish individual, nor can Ibanish from my mind the fact that he is not popular amongstNew Zealand officers or men. I have little doubt that youhave also known of this, but, like myself, have preferred tohold your tongue. To my mind, it is a great pity because,unquestionably, General Godley did great service to this Dominion in furthering the interests of the national servicescheme.Personally, Sir Alexander and myself have always beenon the best of terms, and had not his views been so stronglyexpressed on the subject to which I have alluded, I shouldhave said nothing, but should he in course of conversationmention the matter of awards and promotions for those whohave been less fortunate than himself and who have had toremain in New Zealand, I should be grateful ( if you agree ofcourse ) if you would support the views of both myself and myMinisters.I have taken a very strong stand on this questionbecause, from my personal experience in the service, I knowthat a great deal of very good, and indeed invaluable, workhas not received the reward which it merited, because it didnot happen to be in the public eye, and a Rifleman has alwaysbeen brought up to help those who are not so fortunately placedas himself. Believe me,Yours sincerely,Liverpool. GOVERNMENT HOUSE DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON, PERSONAL AND SECRET

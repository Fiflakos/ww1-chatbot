Author: James Joseph Makin Location: No 1 Command Depot Sutton Veny WiltsDate: 27 July 1918Nationality: Australian Text: My dearest Mother & Father, I trust you will not be very grieved to hear I have left London and am going to be a soldier once more. You must know how fed up and disgusted I have been during the past twelve months. It finally got unbearable and I threw in the sponge. I am glad to say I go away without getting a crime against my name. I have been here 3 days now and am just dropping into my stride. The life is quite enjoyable and I shall be feeling the benefit of the change in a few weeks time. I shall probably be just leaving England by the time you get this letter. I am quite confident that I shall come through alright and have noapprehensions about going back . Les is at present on a few days leave in London, probably his last before going to France. I am only about 1 miles distant from his camp and shall see him next Tuesday. I am trying to arrange a transfer to his brigade, not necessarily to his battalion. I think it were best to address my letters to my pal as follows : - 3862 Private J.J Makin, 21st Battalion A.I.F c/o Cpl. C F Juergens, 27 Chesilton Road, Munster Park London S.W.6. When I am definitely settled I shall advise you further. I met Graydon Burston, an old U.H.S boy, here yesterday. He has been over in England since October and, is likely to be here on a base job for some time. I received your large parcel the day I marched out from London. I think it was the one you sent for my birthday. It contained a large cake, sugar, cocoa, cafe' au lait, chocolate, cigarettes & and of course was very acceptable. I am very grateful indeed. I had a letter from Dr Gibson two or three days ago saying he had received some papers for me. I have told him to redirect them to me, but I am afraid they will never find me. My latest letter from you is dated 9/5. There is a mail in dated about 23/5 but I have not got any letters up to date by that: I must expect them to be delayed a while now. I must ask you again not to worry about me. I shall be as right as a bank. You must realize it is almostTwo years now since I left my battalion, and that it is time I did a bit more and took a few risks. Perhaps you will think that I do not consider your feelings and that I am inconsiderate, but I repeat Lovelace's "Lines in Going to the Wars" : "Tell me not sweet I am unkind, ____ ____ ____ ___ ____ ____ etc "I could not love thee half so well "Loved I not honor more." It were even so much better to be stoical, and should bad news ever reach you, bear it as did the Spartan mothers of ancient Greece. I cannot write more now, so will conclude with love to all you dear people at home. Believe me, I am always thinking of you. Your affectionate son Jim

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 20 April 1915Location: Gallipoli Turkey Nationality: Australian Text: The Official War Historian of the CommonwealthGovernment (Dr. C. E. W. Bean), after his study of thecollection of private war records preserved in the AustralianWar Memorial Library, wrote:The private diaries in this collection furnish some of its mostvaluable historical records, but, like all private memoirs which werenot compiled with any historical purpose, they should not beregarded as first hand evidence except where it is certain that theyare so. The diarist is almost always sincere in his desire to recordaccurately, but he is subject to no obligation or inducement toindicate whether he is recording his own observations or incidentstold him by friends or heard at third or fourth hand at the mess-table.Thus, in some of the diaries in this collection, scenes described withvivid detail, and without any warning that they are told at secondor third hand, have been found to be completely inaccurate inimportant details. A certain number also have been written upor revised long after the events, though doubtless usually from notesmade at the time. In most cases the student must rely on hisexperience and on internal evidence to guide him in judging what isand what is not likely to be historically accurate.

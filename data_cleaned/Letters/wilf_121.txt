Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 9 July 1918 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Port Said Nationality: Australian Text: 9.7.1918. My dear mother,I am still enjoying my trip to hospital &expect to return next Sunday. It has been a treat to havetime fully occupied here as I have had 150 patients to lookafter & they take quite a lot of time. Then we have swimming,I often go in three times a day as it is quite handy & thenwe sometimes go to tennis in Port Said which is verypleasant.I have chummed up with a Major Brownhere, one of the surgeons, & we took a couple of the nursesto tennis one afternoon & dinner afterwards. Anotherafternoon Comins who is a dentist formerly attached tothe 3rd LHF Amb, & now down here, & I went downwith another couple of nurses one afternoon to theArmenian refugee camp which is a few miles downthe canal from here. We sailed down & the girls hada lot of shopping to do for different people as theArmenians make handkerchiefs, laces etc, & sell quitea lot of stuff. When I saw the hankys I thoughtyou & Mab might like some so I bought adozen & also a quaint little coat which Ithought might be of use for one of the young niecesor nephews, whichever it would fit. It was quite aqueer little thing & looked as if it might be usefulAt any rate I hope you like the handkerchiefs.An Australian mail has arrived, but I have rathermissed it, as it has probably gone out to the field for me & won't get mine for a few days.When we were at the Armenian camp our boat crackedit's sail & couldn't return, so we had to breast up toa naval officer who was there with a fine motor launch& was buying some things with some ladies, & weasked him if he would rescue us as there wereno other boats. He was very decent about it & offwe went in great style & had some tea in Port Saidon our way back. Quite a number of officers I knoware sick in hospital here & I often pop in & havea talk with them so that time goes very rapidlyI'm not looking forward very much to returning to thefield & the valley of the Jordan but it must be doneso there's no use regretting it.We went over one day & had a look over a boatwhich is returning to Australia with sick & woundedshortly & upon which I hope to send this letter withsome of the people who are travelling on her. Shewas very much fitted out & comfortable & Icertainly wished that I could stow myselfaway on her somewhere. I will have more tosay I hope when I receive my mail my dearso will close this with the very best of love & manya big hugfromYour loving son,Wilf.If I succeed in sending this by a passenger, I expectyou will get this letter in the shortest time for a long while.

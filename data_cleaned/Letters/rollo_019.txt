Jacko seems to be playing a very shrewd game - ie - menacing the Canal area without the actual attacking. For months we have been waiting & watching - gradually sneaking forward & getting reinforced, but we have been waiting for him to come onHe got burnt fingers at Jif Jaffa (about 60 miles away) by the 9th L.H. & a few days later got a bit back on some Pommies (Yeomanry) at Ismailia & Katia. The Yeom. shot their horses instead of fighting a mounted rear-guard action - & lost 40 killed about70 wounded prisoners, 100 camels, 30 horses & their transport The 5th L.H. managed to pull them out of it after a gallop of 8 miles - but their horses were too much done to follow up & re-capture the loot.Since then Jacko has been pretty cocky & as theBedouin agents inform us they have a regiment of Huns, a battalion of Austrians, & some 8.2 howitzers - with a full gunned Turkish Division only 40 miles away. the fun may start at any minute. It is reported that a Tabur (4000 men) is only a night's march away. Rollo. Letter 5.5.16 to Harry describing Zoo etc

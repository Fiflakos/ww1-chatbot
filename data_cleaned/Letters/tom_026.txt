Author: Thomas Anderson Whyte Rank: Private Date: 6 March 1915 Location: Lemnos Greece Regiment: 10th Infantry Battalion 3rd Bridgade Nationality: Australian Text: At Lemnos Saturday, March 6, 1915. My Dear Eileen There will probably be a mail going out at 4.30pm, the first chance I have had of dropping you a line since No 17, pages 53 to 56. The previous letter to that was one posted in Alexandria Cairo last Sunday No 16 pages 40-52. No 17 was posted in Alexandria on March 1st. From page fifty seven I am writing you a letter which [[I will]] post when the opportunity offers. The censorship is to be very strict I believe so don't be disappointed if with this short note. We have not had any war news this month and are all wondering how things are going especially [Censored] I am in tip top nick & feeling very well so are all the others you know. I wrote a letter to mother & Teo but do not know whether they they will pass or not I detest this censorship more than you do. There seems nothing you can say. I wrote a letter to you yesterday but had to tear it up as it had no chance of passing. I haven't seen Gay for some time but wouldn't be surprised to run across her in a few weeks as there is some talk of that lot following taken all through we have had a good time the last week. What our job will be there is no knowing. At present it looks like as if we would still be doing something similar to the last 3 months. I can't think of anything more to say, except goodnight Yours truly, Tom There ought to be another mail within aweek or two.

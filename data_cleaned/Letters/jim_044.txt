Author: James Joseph Makin Regiment: 9th / 21st Battalion Location: Zietoun Cairo Egypt Date: 10 March 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother and Father, I arrived safely in Suez two days ago and came by train to Zeitoun, a camp several miles from Cairo, last night. As it was midnight when we arrived here I am unable to say what Cairo is like yet, but before long I hope I shall be able to tell you all about this ancient city. My first impressions of Egypt are more favorable than I hoped, and so far everything it has far exceeded my expectations. We had a splendid trip over, the water being smooth right from W.A. and the weather perfect. We are very glad to hear news of the war again. Three or four weeks news are a blank to us but we are just about putting two and two together now and forming an idea of the situation. There is great excitement about the big offensive in France and the reported departure of the German fleet westward. Let us hope it will soon meet its Trafalgar. The Germans must be making their last big effort; perhaps the "situation is desperate". The news from the Balkans and Persia is better than when we heard last, and the death of Enver Pasha from the assassin's hand shows that things are only "middling" in Turkey. We have no idea of the losses of either Germans or Allies in the recent attack on Verdun, but the German loses are said to be very high. It is too soon to form an opinion of the camp just yet but the reports of Australians here say that it is a "good home". No one has any idea how long we shall be here but it should not be very long I think. We disembarked at Port Suez at 9.30 am. yesterday and waited for a train till 4 pm. We ran straight through Suez, and one could only get a hasty impression of this town. There are some fairly large buildings, - white in color and which appear to be built of a kind of cement over a wooden framework. There are one or two straight streets; the rest are narrow irregular alleyways in which natives in their gay-colored flowing garments move aimlessly along. Close to the line railway one got a glimpse of what looked like coffee or drinking houses; chairs and tables are set both inside and out, and natives clad in many colored gowns and red fezes sit smoking and drinking. There was not much to see once out of the town and the train sped merrily on through semi- desert country. Here and there one could see that Britain is not taking any risks with the Canal. There were many camps - "Tommies," Indians, and Australians, and endless camels with their native drivers. Even as we dashed through, the wonderful spirit of the Allies was evident. Here one sees a team of Tommies trying their skill at soccer with an equally keen team of Indians, unmindful of the heavy going of the desert sand or of the dust and grit stirred up as they 'mixed it' with a will. As we stopped at each siding money-thirsty natives boarded the train and tried to show their skill at bargaining in their sales of "ollangies" or "orrringies" with the too - suspecting Australians. The oranges were a boon after the dry biscuits and cheese with which we had been issued for the day's rations. The railway carriages (3rd class) are very crude compared with Victoria's. The only thing in them is a hard seat and a light. Their are doors at each end and a division down the centre like a Tail car. There was not much room when we settled down with full marching order, sea-kits and rifles. We were about 7 hours in the train and when we arrived in Cairo we were mighty glad to get out and have a stretch. We walked about a mile to the camp, were housed in 2 huts (100 in each), got a couple of blankets and turned in about 1 am. We were up again at 6 am but anticipated an easy day. There is a mail closes today, so I have taken the first opportunity to send you these few lines. I have not time for any more so I shall close with love to all From Your affectionate son, Jim P.S Tell Harry I have not time to write this mail but will write next week for certain. Am sending a cable this afternoon.

Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: County of London War Hospital Epsom Surrey England Date: 5 December 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:My Dearest Mother & all at Home,Well, here I am in England.Who would have thought that Iwould ever get so far round theworld 2 years ago? Well, anyhowhere I am, so anything is possibleafter this.Now to tell you my story,starting from the 18th StationaryHospital at Lemnos Island.As soon as I was convalsocent,I was sent to the LowlandCasualty Clearing Hospital towait for a boat to take me toeither England or Australia, asthis is the usual course adopted with all Enteric Cases. Somemisunderstanding arose thro'wrongly reading a MilitaryOrder which concerned theAustralian & New ZealandersThe order was to the effectthat "no disabled Australiansor New Zealanders were to besent to England, but were tobe sent to Australia, & the18th Hospital Authoritiesevidently thought that EntericCases came under this heading& so we had to miss the boatwhich we were previouslybooked for, whilst their errorwas rectified, & so we cameon the big "Aquitania".It would take too long forme to tell you here the complete description of the boatbut enough to say thatshe makes all other boats &liners look like canoes incomparison. Well, when wegot on board, we entered anElectric Lift, of which Icounted up & I believe there areothers. It was just like beingin a big building goingpast the different decks.When we got to "C" Deck(we got in at "G" deck) we wentalong a very long passagetowards the stern & passedhundreds of beds, where thecabins usually were, & wepassed the bannister overlookingthe 1st class diningsaloon, & this enormous place contained nothing butbeds (750 in all) it was simplywonderful. There were nofewer than 1044 on our deckalone, & on other be decksthere were beds which broughtthe total number in the wholeship to 7,000. We only carried4000 patients on this trip.Big as the "Aquitania" is, sheis able to turn & manoevre easyenough & away she went.The speed has been cutdown to 18 knots instead of23 knots on account of thevibration affecting the woundedWe called at Naples, Italyfor coal & water & I was onlyable to buy a few Post Cardsfrom one of the boats which sells these sort of things. Wecould see the Vesuvius Volcanonot far away, & it was smoking& at night, it looked very fineas the top was a red glowas a furnace, which showedus that it isn't extinct byany means. Pompeii is on theother side to the Harbour ofthe Volcano & I was able tosecure a book of views ofthe ruins which I amsending to you with the P.CsThe "Mauretania" wasalongside of us in Naples& we took up nearly all theQuay.We left then for Gibraltarat daybreak & when we arrivedthere, I was very much impressed with the great impregnable fortIt is a great high rock & itfairly bristles with Guns.Right at the top of it amongThe clouds we could see 4great guns which can shootright across the MediterraneanThe town looked very cosysituated in a little valleybeneath the great guns.The houses, like those atNaples, are very tall & seemto have no chimneys. Weonly stayed for an houruntil a despatch boat broughtus our Orders & then we sailed.As on my trip from dearold Australia, I felt veryoff color & kept on my backpretty well all the time Big as she (the boat) is, sheis not a good sailer, & whenwe got into the notoriousBay of Biscay, she behavedherself very badly & whenshe rolls, she goes over veryfar & takes a terrible time torecover & right herself againThe sailors on board admitthat she is no good as a seaboat as she is top heavy.At night, we could hear thecrockery falling & sliding allover the mess room, & peoplewalking along the passageswere cutting all sorts of capers& one particularly amusingincident caused me to nearlysplit my sides with laughingTwo of the Chaplains coming back from the supper roomarm-in-arm were staggeringalong crashing first on onewall, then on the other & theylooked, from behind, like apair of drunks rolling homeat midnight on a SaturdayThey only wanted a Crayfish under each arm & itwould have been complete.The food on board was,well the least said of it, thebetter. The nurses (English) area very morose lot, & don't seemto care very much about theirjob. The Australian nursessimply lose them, both inwork & looks & manner.Whilst on board, I becamea great favourite of General Hughes of the Light Horse, hewas Mayor of St Kilda, & hewould bring me all kindsof things such as papers,magazines, Tobacco, cigarettesEtc & would have brought meFruits & sweets, only I was onmilk diet & the nurse said itwould only throw me back, butall the same, I was very gratefulfor his kindness. I was veryglad when the boat reachedSouthamton, & it was veryfoggy & we anchored outsideuntil daybreak & next day,it was a drizzling rain nearlyall the time, but by the timethe 4 tugs got us into dock,it cleared somewhat & thedisembarking of the patients.

Author: Thomas Anderson Whyte Rank: Private Date: 18 March 1915 Regiment: 10th Infantry Battalion 3rd Bridgade Nationality: Australian Text: March 18, 1915. My Dear Eileen, Everything is going along smoothly. We are gradually settling down to troopship life though it is not the most enjoyable Heard today we are likely to be here for some time It is 3 weeks since we have seen a mail but one is expected daily charge We get a summary of the official war news each day which serves to keep us slightly in touch with the world. French I have an idea Gay is here, but exactly where at I don't know. Not a sign of the others yet. Rumours say they have not left the last base yet. Since the first the last week or so I have been doing a good deal of rowing in ships jigs. Practically the same crew as at Aden rows the Brigadier round. Its much more interesting than sloping and route marches I am up to page 92 in the book, but what chance there is of posting I can't even guess. You might ask Tom to ring up Rev F.H. Stokes & give him what information you have gathered. I am afraid you will have to wait for any news until there is a chance of sending those carbon pages. 19/3/1915 Friday A library was opened to-day. The crew being off duty, owing to a trip ashore last night, I was able to read one of McCutcheons novels 'Nedra' The finish is most perplexing. I didn't know whether to feel disgusted or pleased. But I expect you have read it. Up to page 96 with only 4 to go to complete the book I haven't another so will have to fall back on odd scraps of paper. How I long for a letter. It seems worse than that 3 weeks at Mena. The last couple of weeks has been quite civilized actually, sleeping in pyjamas on a smoking room couch. The pattern of the saddleback seems to me exactly the same as Tom's & Freda's I have the use of a very nice marble topped card table to do any writing. How long it will last I cant say. Fisher has been down with tonsolitis but all the others are well. They are very strict on the censoring It is only owing to Cap Green's kindness I have been able to send more than one page. They have service postcards printed with phrases like 'I am well' 'I am in hospital' 'I am wounded'. You cross out what is not wanted. Not sure if 'I am dead' is on them. Old B4 is still the most disliked in the whole battalion even among the officers I think. I always feel like punching his bald greasy countenance whenever I see it The food has been a lot better the last couple of days since we have had our own cooks in the galley. I can't think of any more to say so goodnight Yours ever Tom Love to all.

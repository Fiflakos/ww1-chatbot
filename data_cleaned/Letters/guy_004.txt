We have been herenearly a month now, I think you would callus, a sort of third line of defence for theCanal. We are leaving here next Thursday, forthe first line, I think.In your last letter, you said Rupert had joinedon to the 7th Batallion 1st Platoon, I have madeenquiries, two or three times, but can find notrace of him, I think you must have givenme the wrong address.Do you remember Jim Watts of Seckington ^This pristine village England hehas joined up with A Compy, of 2nd Batallion,he came with the 9th reinforcements & joinedhis Batallion up here, he looks pretty wellon it, he tells me his Father is pretty wella cripple, (caused from a stroke), is not ableto do any work yet.I hope you spent Xmas at Shackerstone or Brighton & had a good time.We got treated very well for Xmas, asregards parcels etc. We were all issuedout with ^Xmas billys' (consisting of all kinds of eatables,chocolates etc.) & also plum puddings. Wealso got our own parcels from home; sowe are still having Xmas gifts, as parcelsstill keep arriving for somebody in thetent.They won't allow us much leave now,since we have been here, one per. unit. ofCompany have been allowed daily; it is abit stiff, isnt it, after all we havegone through at the Peninsula. I gotmy leave into Cairo, the second day wewere here, owing to being one of thelongest on the Peninsula. I think there areonly about 8 out of our Company been withthe Batallion all along.With loveYour affectionate son,Guy Arnold. Pte G H Arnold 1311B Company2nd Batallion1st Infty Brig

Author: James Joseph Makin Location: FranceDate: 4 June 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France, 4/6/1916 Dearest Mother & Father, There is no mail out this week but I am writing now so that it will not seem a long time between the dates of my letters. You can always rest assured that I write every mail, and that if they do not arrive regularly, they are delayed somewhere. Since my last letter several of your letters have come to hand, and also two parcels. The third one containing socks, which you mention as having sent, has not yet come, but will come in time I hope. I am glad to hear that you are getting letters regularly from Les. This should relieve you of some of your anxiety. I trust you are not worrying over me, for I am "A1 at Lloyd's"- as Mr. Irwin used to say. There is not much prospect of me being in any scraps for a good while yet I am afraid, and when I do get there, you must not think I shall "forget to duck". I was rather surprised to hear that Jack Frood had enlisted, but supposed he was married before this. I do not remember ever putting my name on any locker at Broadmeadows, but it is just possible that it got there. It was rather strange that he should have seen it, in any case. You did not say whether the Ballarat people enjoyed themselves, but I daresay they appreciated the change. Plenty of pictures at the Danc, suppose? I can imagine you were awaiting my letter from Egypt anxiously. There was no mail despatched between Perth and Suez, which accounts for the long time. I was glad you got my cable, otherwise you may have been worried. It has been said in some letters that there was a rumour abroad that the Warilda was sunk, but I trust you never heard it. It is rather funny to think of you writing to me on April, 4th thinking I was melting under a burning Egyptian sun, and toiling on desert sands, when at that time I was here with the temperature almost at freezing point and being almost pierced with cold winds. Too bad, altogether! But since then the weather has become almost perfect. We have now had a succession of many weeks of beautiful Spring weather, and at times the sun has been quite hot. I am anxious to know when my letters from Egypt arrived, and if my diary "materialized". You must not judge it too harshly, for I make no attempt to obtain any literary effect, but strive only to record my doings from day to day as simply as possible, and as briefly as is convenient. Please overlook any mistakes, and attribute them more to carelessness than to ignorance. At present my diary makes much more entertaining reading, but to send it, I am afraid, would be quite out of the. question. I have not received any papers from home, but they are sent to the battalion, where it would be too much trouble to return them back to here. I daresay they are appreciated up there, nevertheless. It would be better, if you wished one to see anything of interest in a paper, to cut it out and enclose it in your letters. I think I have all Ruby's letters but none from Perce so far. Tell him to write now and then, for I am very interested in his school work. Does he still forget his lunch now and then? I am writing to Ruby this mail also and I can tell her about the parcels better. Trusting you will keep in good spirits and keep up a brave front, and until I write again, Your affectionate son, Jim.

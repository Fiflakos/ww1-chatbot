Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 22 November 1915 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Anzac Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 9th Light Horse Regiment,Anzac,November 22nd 1915My dear mother,No mail has reached me since last week exceptone of the parcels sent from Egypt containing chicken broth (which I had ordered) Ifear that we will miss a mail as we have been informed that alarge number of mail bags were lost in a boat which was sunkby a submarine - very bad luck for us. Since writing you theweather has become bitterly cold & we have been glad to puton warmer attire one item of which is sheepskin jackets madefrom the whole hide of a sheep & which were a present tothe regiment & they do look funny with the hide worn outside &the fur inside & fashioned as a jacket for the upper partof the body. It is too unpleasant sitting round at night inthe cold so we retire to our dugouts & I get into bed, whichconsists of a stretcher with a soft mattress from my sleepingbag on top of it & on this I have two blankets sewn togetherso as to form a bag & I slip into this put another blanketor two on top & then in order to read & keep my upperbody warm put on my cardigan & sheepskin & I'mas snug as a bug in a rug. I have managed toobtain a lamp now so am quite well able to read.I am still in my old dug out with the New Zealanderalso as he has been unable to obtain anything to coverhis place with, when I remove my tarpaulin to mynew dressing station so I am remaining here until he gets what he wants as we could hardlygo & leave him without a roof to his head.It is a bit crowded but we manage & whenwe go to bed about seven at night we talk & sopass time in addition to reading & my batmanbrings in some cocoa about nine o'clock so that afterall, even under these circumstances life is not so bad. A MedicalAssociation has been formed at Anzac which meetsevery fortnight at No 1 Casualty Clearing Station &Addison (the New Zealander) & l went along & Wesleystayed at home as it was his turn to do so, becauseit is necessary for one man always to be at handThere was a very large attendance in the big tentwhich was used for the meeting, fully fifty medicosbeing present. I met fellows whom l had not seenpreviously for twelve months & quite enjoyed doingso & then we had a discussion on an Epidemic ofJaundice which is prevalent just now, fortunatelyonly a mild thing, the men being off color inmore ways than one for a few days. Last night aTurk prisoner gave himself up in our trenchesa fine built fellow, by race an Armenian who hadbeen forced to serve. He was rather a fine builtfellow with aquiline features & a large nose& rather fair skinned. He was dressed inthe 8 usual Turkish overcoat of greyishwool which is a very warm & his clothes werein good condition & his socks very good. He appeared well fed also & is believed tohave been a sergeant. The first indication ofhis presence was given by his calling outnear our trenches just about dusk, & one of ourfellows, very small in stature too, hearing him replied& then jumped over the parapet bayonet in hand& brought him into the trench with great pride. TheTurk had left his cap & rifle behind & was shiveringwith cold, so our kindly fellows took him to a fire & warmedhim & gave him a good meal & then he was brought downblindfolded & under escort to headquarters. Somekind chap had given him a muffler for his head &they treated him generally as a kind of pet. Th Hissmall captor, proud as a game cock, formed part ofhis escort & formed an amusing contrast to hislarge prisoner. When he was being taken away fromheadquarters the way he was addressed by his guardamused me very much - "Come on Johnny" said theescort & away he went though he understood no EnglishOur lads always speak to the Ghurkas by calling themJohnny & l suppose it was natural for them to addresshim thus. The parcel which l received from Egypttoday was one of the missing ones unfortunately notthe chocs. but some soup which we had tonightWe are to have a winter issue of rations commencing onDec. 1st including oatmeal, cheeze, pea soup & cocoawhich will be very much appreciated. Oatmeal particularlywe will be glad of as the men all appear to desire that at present rather than any other item of diet.I am Secretary of the Officer's Mess at present &arrange all the meals & duties of the officers' batmanin regard to drawing water & wood for the mess& so on. It entails a little extra work but keepsme employed. In addition I help censor letterswhen I have time. I have been wondering sincereading your September letters if my cablegram announcingmy departure to Gallipoli arrived after Ern & Alice left& hope sincerely that it did not just at the timewhen you would be fell feeling lonely. Your letterswhich I hope to receive soon after you hadreceived the telegram will enlighten me as regardsthat. I hope that you are well & am longingnow for some more letters & hope that the gapbetween the change in my addresses will not betoo long & hope you continued to write to the oldone from whence they were forwarded. I have receivedthe 4 Australian letters since my arrival here,two from you, one from Mab, one from Cedric Job, &one or two from Egypt. I am very well & in goodspirits & hope you are the same & all the EvansThomas family. Much love to all the dear oneswish I could drop in & see them all & aspecial share for mother fromHer loving son,Wilf.

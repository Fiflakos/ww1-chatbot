It is very pleasant tocome to civilization once again butthere is a heat wave just at present& we are sweltering & sweating day &night. But for all that I amenjoying life well. Tonight I haddinner with the Bryans & went tochurch with them & told them Iexpected a brother here shortlyso must send Jack along to themwhen he arrives. I heard todaythat reinforcements were expectedat Moasca & met the Adjutantof the camp there who was returning there tonight & he promisedto wire me whether they arrivedor not & if Jack has comeI will go back earlier & spenda day there. We had a wretchedtrip down on the other side ofthe canal - spent the nightin an open truck half smotheredwith soot from the engine.I never thought when Iused to hear of people travellingin open trucks that I woulddo it & can't say I appreciatedthe experience very much - hopeI can do better on the returntrip. I have been round thehospital seeing some of ourwounded & some of the nursesI know - they all look abit fagged after their recent hard work. This place is very comfortableto stay at, but at presentalmost unbearable indoors.Parry who went through theuniversity with me came upwith me & it makes thingsmuch more pleasant to havea companion. We wentfor a run out to The Barageof which you have heardme speak & also to thePyramids both of themvery nice trips indeed.But my dear its far toohot inside. Ill write morewhen I go back to the desert so will close withmuch love fromYour loving & very hot sonWilf.

He was wounded and has since been unable to rejoin his Corps. On Tuesday, 1st December, the king made an early start by motor on his tour of the Indian troops and the IVth Army Corps. On his way to the HQ of the former he passed several detachments drawn up alongside the road. On arrival at the HQ HM was received by the General Officer Commanding who presented to him the Indian Princes and the Officers of the staff. He then inspected the various bodies of Indian troops which had been paraded, the Sowars and Sepoys showing the same pleasure at his visit as the British soldiers though perhaps in a more restrained manner. The next move was to the various divisional headquarters, where the precedent was similar, more troops being collected at each place. A halt was called at the Field Ambulance where the preparation of the native food was watched with interest, HM King tasting a chapatti which had just been cooked. At one place the King made a distribution of decorations. Amongst the recipient of the Victoria Cross were 2 young gunners who were neither 20 years of age.

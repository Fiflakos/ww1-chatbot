Author: Nabokoff Date: 14 November 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: November 14,1917My dear General,This is just a shortline to offer you myheartiest congratulationson your promotion. Itdiffers, I am sure, fromany other " recognition ofbrilliant services to the country" in that it willcause satisfaction andpride not only to therecipient, but also totens of thousands of menwhose soul he is. Youknow now deeply I amdevoted to you, so thereis no need for me to tellyou that I feel exactlyas happy about it as anyman serving under you.News from Russia isstill conflicting. Onething is certain - thatthis is the last phase oftreasonable indecisionand imbecility on thepart of the Government.The one question whichis causing me intenseapprehension is thestability of the Russo -Roumanian front. Anenemy success in that region would be areal calamity not onlyto Roumania and Russia,but to the Alliance, as itwould give Germany anearly access to the granaryof Russia.With best wishes andsincerest regardsYours ever,Nabokoff

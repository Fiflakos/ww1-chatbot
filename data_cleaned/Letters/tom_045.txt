Text: THE OLD.THE NEW. The Mercantile Rowing Club is making a new departurein S.A. Rowing in holding combined Scratch Eights. Membersof all clubs have been asked to participate and theresponse has been more than gratifying. The proceeds fromthe entrance fees will augment the Building Fund to theextent of 8. The present shed was built 25 years ago and it is superfluousto say it needs replacing. Plans have been preparedfor a two storey jarrah structure with a flat roof for viewingthe races ; the cost will be 750. Rowing is an expensivesport and an additional drawback is the absence of any outsidehelp in the shape of gate money. The upkeep of theboathouse and boats takes every penny of the 60 oddmembers' subscriptions of 30/- each. As each member hasto pay for all entrance fees, training expenses, etc., toincrease the subscription would cause a lot of the members todrop out. We cannot charge you for admission to viewraces, but if you would care to add a little to the Ioo wehave already collected from members only, kindly fill in theform below and give it to any member.

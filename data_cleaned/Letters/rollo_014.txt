Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: SerapeumDate: 30 April 1916 Nationality: Australian Text:I am only sending a few snaps this time& a line.Everything is quiet here - altho we areexpecting a raid at any time - either by air - or mounted Arabs - but we will be a bit more ready for them than the Yeomanry were at Katia.The air raid at Port Said did not do much damage - our chaps soon chased the beggars away - will send more news later.The views - are private - furry details of some of our minor trenches - & the work we did last Feb. The mailboat looks well. A bit of light got on the film - but it rather improved it. One view shows the mosaic paths at the Zoo - made from colored pebbles. Very beautiful but hard to photograph.P. of. W. is just saluting (my own snap) At the Barrage the arches are 30' wide - & at the time we were there the water was 40' above the lower level - Some dam Eh?No news - but should be some soon - so close now with love to all especially yourselves.RolloWish Harry "many happy returns" of May 24.

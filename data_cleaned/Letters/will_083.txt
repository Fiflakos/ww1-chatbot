Author: H P Lynch Date: 8 May 1917 Nationality: British Text: 8.5.1917.My dear Birdie.Neill went up to explainhow things stand this morning.I am awfully disappointed atyour not getting out for the restyou all deserve so much. ButI dont see any way out of thedifficulty. We are left with thebattered 62nd & 7n Divns -& the raw 58th - & it would notbe possible to hold our present front with only those 3 Divnsespecially having regard to theextremely sore point we have thrustinto the side of the Bosche.Things would ease down a lotif & when the III Army wouldcome along, but their advance seemsproblematical, & anyhow till theydo, there seems no other possibilitythan to keep in some of your DivnsAll that can be done, is totry & keep things fairly quiet,to let as many officers & men goon leave as possible, & to get youall out later. I've have just beenspeaking to Tandy - at G.H.Q.& he says there is a chance ofgetting you all out in a monthstime, & on the strength of that, Iwill write a letter asking officiallythat that should be doneif the military situation makes it at all possible.Meanwhile I hope you &your staff will be able to getaway on a spell of leave bydriblets from now on -Yrs everH.P.

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: FranceDate: 10 August 1917 Nationality: Australian TextWe are still out of it - very much to our disgust againfor after travelling miles on foot & getting well into the "zone"of the present action we are noting indications that we arenot going to do any further work here.It is a pity for our boys have been a long time nowwithout action they are all as keen as mustard & very anxiousto get with IT. This fooling around mucking about tactictry our patience to the utmost, and as we have had theboys up to "concert pitch" so long, we are very disappointed.Many times now we have been posted - Last May wewere to have had a job - a raid on Machetich Waditwo battalions & a squad of Lt. Horse - but at the last minutethat scheme was abandoned. Again we were sent out tothe front line to stop a projected Turkish Canal attack -but Jacko didn't turn up. The Darfur & Senussi jobswere given to the Pommies - so we missed those.Next we came here - & our Div. has not had one raidas we are always shifted just as our turn was coming off.We missed the big stunt at Armentieres (Fleurbaix?) - because wewere wanted here, now we seem to have missed thisI can tell you we feel awfully disappointed as we'reall in absolute readiness to push off, but the order togo forward hasn't come.My men are all collectively & separately well trainedfor bomb throwing, Lewis gun work &c. and they are intip top form. I don't know how we will keep them occupiedas things are getting monotonous - but we hope to go in yet.No more news. Recd your letters early June.Best of all good wishes for health, &c with much love from, Rollo.

Since I last wrote we have moved aboutconsiderably & quickly, & the day after my birthdayfound us taking over a certain sector of the front linefurther to the right of our August position. Theconditions are pretty bad - but the experience unique.To get anywhere near our front line we have totoil through about a mile of sticky mud, of varyingdepth up to 8' or so - & deeper still in the shell-holes.In wet weather this is infinitely worse.We had about 3" of snow when we were right infront - & you can imagine the mess when this beganto thaw at dawn - & with rain &c., we can claim tohave soldiered in every sort of weather & clime. A military man sees nothing poetic in the allegedbeauty of a snowfall - (in the front lines anyhow)This trip we merely held ground & didn't go "overthe top" - but we go in again in two days' time -but we don't know if any special job is on.Fritz is by no means running short of shells, & hegave us a particularly hot time last trip - but amerciful Providence spared me once more.In your letter (Sept 17) you mention about somany of our Stunts being on Sundays. We realisethat here - & undoubtedly the thought, that at thattime more than any others, - our dear ones arebeseeching the Almighty for our welfare - gives usconfidence, & the courage to get up & do what is requiredin the face of the most hellish conditionsI have had some marvellous escapes - but that littleprayer "God help me" has often been answered, & Ihope will always so be - whenever I have to use it inmatters of supreme emergency againWe are well looked after - so don't worry on thatscore - rubber thigh boots, leather jerkin well lined -two lots of gloves - keep us O.K. - while we constantlywear our greatcoats - & have a system of frequentlychanging wet for dry sox &c. Whale oil is use freely,& 'Trench feet" is practically non-existent. Nov. 11thXmas card from Rollo.-50th Battalion- From Lt Col.

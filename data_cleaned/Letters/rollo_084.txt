We move right up tomorrow and infive days' time I hope to give you all details ofour stunt.The information we gather is that Fritz doesn'tput up much of a personal fight (infantry anyhow) unless they can do so without risk of getting hurt.The Artillery does all the fighting for them andif we can only let our cavalry get loose - doubtlessthey too will up hands & "Kamerad"!The Australians seem a true type of Britishsoldier (judging by old standards) some of thePommy K. of K. lot are very so so and onelot let one of our battalions down very badly theother day but never again.I have seen a few of the old 10th., & some of old mates.Mattner & Carthew are here in tip top fettle , JoeBlackett is 2 Lieut now, but Dickinson is postedas missing probably killed. His battn was beingrelieved, but seeing a casualty in another battn.he went across & dressed the wound, then disappeared .McKail was wounded & back at a dressing station toldto walk to Ambulance - but instead went back to helphis chums - & was killed going up. I have Dickin toavenge now. I will do my utmost, Love & best wishes, Rollo-

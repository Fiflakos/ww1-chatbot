Author: Imam Moulvi Sadruddin Date: 30 October 1914 Location: India office Nationality: Indian Text: 1. I went to Waking on 30 October 1914 with Col. Selwys of the India Office and interviewed Moulvi Sadruddin (Imam of the Waking Mosque). It would appear that both the Commandant of the hospital at Netley and the India office (see 1, 3 & 4) are under a misapprehension as to the arrangements existing for the burial of Mohamedans. There is no Moslem cemetery at Wakings near the mosque, the Moslem cemetery is at Brookwood (four and half miles away) where grave space can be obtained. Moulvi Sadruddin is most emphatic that every effort should be made to obtain land near the mosque at Woking for the burial of Mahomedan soldiers. His reasons are a) If there were frequent burials he would have much difficulty in getting to Brookwood to officiate. b) A certain number of Mohamedans are required to assist with the burial rites. These can be found in Woking but not at Brookwood. c) He wishes the cemetery to be near the mosque in order to show it to Indian officials who visit the Mosque. The Mosque is the only one in England and is frequently visited by influential Indians. There are considerate difficulties in attaining land at Waking for the purpose of a cemetery and which the site mentioned in minute nine (9) presents the Extracts relating to theburial of Muslim soldiers,30 October 1914 These extracts are from a report on theinternment of Muslim soldiers, summarising reasons put forward by Moulvi (Imam) Sadruddin for the choice of a Muslim burial ground near the mosque in Woking. For political reasons, so as not to give any cause for concern and jeopardise British rule in India, the British government was willing to agree to the establishment of a Muslim burial ground.

Dear Eileen, A mail is leaving today for Egypt, M but I dont think there is a connecting one at Port Said next week for Australia; however I don't like to miss a chance. I was able to get No 18 cor covering from March 3rd to March 22nd (page. 40 - 100.) off on the latter date. C5 went with it partly explanatory. There is just a chance of it getting through. for There is some talk of us landing here for a while. A spell ashore would be pleasant. It is well over three weeks since we had a mail. I heard the reason was that the Egyptian authorities did not want to take any chances of betraying our position. However, I believe we will have one in a weeks time as I heard Gen. Birdwood had cabled. No sign of Gay yet. Everything is going along well. I think we are in for a good time. With Love, Tom. here for a month I thinkwaiting fora hundred thousands troops hamilton is in charge the French leave first 3rd Brigade forming covering party for landingthree weeks

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 4 July 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Father & Mother, We have had another shift since I last wrote, a little nearer the Front and we are [[?]] at [[?-----nts]] at present - [[?catching?]] all the spare that the enemy tosses over at our Artillery . I don't think Fritz has any special malice against infantry in [[?]] near Artillery pits - but I am certain he has a down on Artillery - so we get much of what was meant for their people. It is a horrible sensation to see tiles flying off one's roof - I've endured that - but others have been less fortunate. [[?I've]] [[?seen]] the [[?]] [[?]] shifted by one shell. Fritz is very busy on the [[?]] [[?]] - but [[Jack?]] took the [[?]] as far as effective work went - Beachy Bill alone gave me over [[our?]] casualties on Anzac Beach - Fritz [[?]] [[?]] gave to compare with that. Major Herbert [[?& I ]] are together [[?]] [[?]] H.Q, in the same [[?billet]], [[?]] [[?]] [[?]] spread out [[?garrisoning]] various places - [[?]] [[?]] pretty long days we have walking[[?]] visiting out details. Herbert is one of the [[?best]], an [[?]] [[?]] [[?]] be [[?]] if the [[?]] had [[?]] [[?]] [[line?]] I [[?am]] [[?exhausted]] a lot of the [[?time]] [[?]] [[?]] [[?]] [[?]] pleased to see me, congratulated me, [[?]] [[?]]

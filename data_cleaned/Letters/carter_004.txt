Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Location: Mena Camp Date: 3 January 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Mena Camp3/1/1915 My Dear Father & Mother.The New Year passed without much to mark it.- - We have been doing a good deal of trench diggingthis week - & the men worked at it with a will.We built some of the latest type - they are peculiar torelate almost the simplest trench possible. - Sir GeorgeReid has been out to see us - - Church Paradetoday - the Dean was much better; he is barracked withthe 3rd Battalion & they are bringing him up the way he shouldgo. If he makes any slip - or preaches for 1 second over10 minutes he has to stand drinks for the mess.This afternoon McKenzie & I went for a ride - we wentabout 5 miles through a large palm plantation &came upon quite a large Arab village (Kerdsa),all stone & sand huts with straw roofs. - We got intothe middle of it somehow & had quite a job getting out -the horses shy at all the camels - Children &native's all swarm round you for 'back sheesh'.We could only get rid of them by galloping off.It would be quite impossible for an ordinary civilianto go there safely. I don't think I'd go in againunarmed.

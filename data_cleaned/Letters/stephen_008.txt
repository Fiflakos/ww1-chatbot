No.16 Section, with me. One of themleft Egypt with me to join the Battalion in France. Theother was already in the Battalion when I joined it. Theyboth were short, medium build, one dark, the other not sodark. I only knew these Allens in A Co. In August 1916these Allens, I and about 5 others were going from the frontline near Houquet farm to Sausage Gully for rations.This was towards evening, but it was quite light. Whilstgoing up Toms Cut near the front line a shell came overand exploded on the parapet, killed the 2 Allen brotherswho were immediately in front of me in the communicationtrench and wounded my brother who was just front of theAllens. It killed both the Allens outright and a mannamed White. I got. my brother away (he was wounded throughthe arm and leg) and do not know what was done with theAllens bodies but feel sure they would be properly buried.I am positive it was the brothers Allen and they werekilled outright.Informant:- W.

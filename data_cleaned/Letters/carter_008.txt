First day we marched from campto the site arriving at midday. After a 4 hourspell we went out to take up a defensive position& dug trenches all night. I had a bit of rest from9 pm to midnight - managed to sleep about an hour -but there were too many stones to be comfortable.Next day was spent in defending the trenches againstthe 4th Bat.

Author: William Birdwood Date: 29 April 1915 Rank: Lieutenant Nationality: Australian Text: My own darling girl, I wrote you last just as I was leaving Mudros Bay on the Queen on 25th for our first venture & already an age seems to have passed. You can hardly imagine the scene & all our feelings. At about Before starting we had taken on board 500 men on each of our three battleships. At about midnight we got opposite our rendezvous & stopped dead while our men got out into boats in absolute silence - a small pinnace taking a tow of about six boats with 250 men. Behind each battle ship came six destroyers in perfect silence stealing along, with their decks crowded with about 400 men on each & dragging tows behind. When we got about 1000 yards from the shore the pinnaces all shot forward with their tows & we had to wait in expectancy the results as the die was cast. It was now quite dark, the moon having set, but unfortunately it was still up when we were well in sight of land & our ships were silhouetted against it. This however we could not help as had we waited longer we would have had to land in day light which I particularly wished to avoid. We heard afterwards from prisoners that they had seen us at 2, so no surprise was possible. You can imagine my anxiety as the boats disappeared in the dark more especially as I realized they were not going in quite the right direction, for instead of due East, they all inclined to their left & landed me a good mile further North than I had intended - but over this I had of course no control & could do nothing. Why I had particularly wanted not to go to the spot in which we were taken was because it at once brought us into some most difficult country in which I feared the troops would be sure to lose themselves in the dark, and this is exactly what happened. But at the same time I am not at all sure that the hand of Providence did not directly guide them into a more sheltered place than we would otherwise have had, and one which on account of its great difficulty had perhaps not been so fully prepared against us as others had been. Straining our eyes through the darkness trying to see if the boats had reached the shore we could see nothing, but presently the cracks of musketry came along & we knew we could not hope for a surprise. There was soon a regular rattle of it, but of course the boats all pressed on & unloaded as fast as they could. I fear they suffered heavily and in one boat alone about 60 men were at once killed - a horrid thing while there was no chance of doing anything to defend oneself. The 1500 men from the boats were followed at once by all those from the destroyers so we had 4000 men ashore in no time. They at once started straight away to attack the huge difficult hill before them & I really do not think there are any troops in the world who could have done it better or more bravely. The whole place is covered with very thick scrub about 4ft high with no paths through it - the hills are very steep & there are many precipices. The men went straight at everything & if possible went along with too much dash for they took on more than we could manage, dashing away to extreme spurs of the hills which were much too extended to hold. The first 4000 were of course followed immediately by more, & by about 8.30 I had 12,000 men ashore. Before then however the heavy guns had started pegging away at us probably from ships (possibly the Goeben's guns) in the Dardanelles firing at us over the land, and from the forts at the Narrows. Many of these plumped in alongside of us, but by great good luck I don't think one ship was hit - at all events badly - several had however to up anchor & beat hasty retreats which somewhat confused our arranged order of landing & lead to confusion later. As I say the covering force dashed ahead & was only natural lost itself to a very great extent. Each new lot of troops as it landed had to be pushed off up the hills to where most urgently wanted & consequently Brigades and Regts soon got hopelessly broken up & no one knew where any of their men were. The Turks all this time were fighting us like the Devil & we afterwards discovered we were opposed by 3 Brigades - and we found they had got trenches everywhere. These I had hardly expected in all the broken hilly country - but we found them covering everywhere, and from these they had to be & were turned out - in fact they were hunted all over the place. The whole time there was a perfect pandemonium of noise - the whole fleet pouring out broadsides and the enemie's shrapnel bursting everywhere. This went on the whole day, though the guns only came into action with the light. My troops had as I say bitten off rather more than we could chew & we had to withdraw somewhat to take up a position we could hold. It was only then I began to discover the awful trouble I was in for owing to the men being so scattered & broken up. They had done absolutely magnificently - nothing had stopped them, and they had accomplished what any army might well be proud of, by effecting their landing in face of such opposition & then taking a position which one would ordinarily alone be a great action. It is for just such work that they are well suited for - viz - to be thrown into an action which wants great dash & recklessness. But, then they had shot their bolt and the most awful reaction followed. Both my Divisional Generals & senior Brigadiers came to me & said it was theirduty to represent to me that the men were absolutely at their end, owing partly to the fearful hard work they had gone through - their very heavy losses - and the terrible strain on their nerves from all the shrapnel fire towhich we had been subjected - and they told me they were convinced that if attacked they would not be able to stand and that a most terrible disaster threatened us. They asked me to wire to Sir Ian H. putting the facts before him & saying I was consequently re-embarking my force, or it might be a case of all having to go hands up! An ordinary retreat is difficult enough, but one including an embarkation would be too awful for words. I of course refused to send such a wire & said in no case could it be hands up as I'd fight to the last even if it meant wiping us all out. I warned Sir Ian of the state the men were in, but hoped for the best. What I really feared was the enemy shelling us all night. We had had no opportunity of any sort of digging in to protect ourselves, so had naturally suffered much. The men were mostly quite new to it, so naturally felt it very much. Though the Turks attacked more or less throughout the night they luckily did not use their guns. You can imagine however what an awful night I had of it. It was very cold & raining a little, & of course I had nothing but what I stood up in, though I found after that that excellent little fellow Steward had carried a blanket for me on his back. We only had one narrow strip of beach for everything - time after time the shrapnel came on it & the confusion looked awful, though it really was not so. What was trying though, was the wounded. There were nearly 2000 of them - men being brought streaming in from all sides & absolutely blocking the whole beach.All we could do was to have them dressed & sent off in every boat which arrived, back to ships. The regular hospital ship was very soon overcrowded & then transports had to be filled up - once they were away it was all right. But the sight of all these men was inclined to try the nerves of my soldiers - and it washere too that the splitting up of Regts camein, in trying the men. Almost before light I started out to go all roundmy firing lines & see what was to be done. I foundthe men already improving since the night before,but whenever I came across a small clumpof men & asked them their Regt, they would say "We20 are all that are left of the 1st Bn. all theothers have been cut up" - and this is whatthey thought. I of course chaffed them & toldthem that just across the valley there wereanother 500 all right & more elsewhere! This dida lot to cheer them up, and fortunately wehadn't a too hard day's fighting. The difficultiesof the country which they had been so magnificentlytackled with their dash, told against them howeverin such circumstances, when the regular soldier'sdiscipline would have helped him - for in thisdense country covered with nullahs, many men

At presentwe are billeted behind the lines as Reserves,and are to go into the trenches shortly.Several of my mates came into thesame company, so I am feeling quiteat home, and not out of place, as I thought I should for some time. We have been doing fatigue work inreserve trenches, building dugouts &e.,rising at 3 am. and returning about11.30 am. The work is a changefrom 10 weeks in the training campalthough it is by no means easy. I have not got any letters sinceI last wrote. There was a mail in herelast night, but I suppose mine have beenreturned to my reinforcements, When you write, address my lettersas above :- No. Name A Company 21st Battalion A.I.F. France I have had a few more letters fromL[[?]]. He tells me you have receivedsome of my letters from Egypt - as wellas the diary. I was glad to hearthey came to hand alright. I havesent some more to Les in London.He will probably post it to you.He has been through a machine-gun course and a grenade coursesince he returned to duty. In hislast letter (2/6/16), he had not heardanything definite about coming across. It is 10 weeks since your last letterso I am looking forward to them shortly. I have not much to tell you this time, and the censorship, from all accounts, is more strict than before. Tell Ruby and Gertie I have no time to write to them this time. I am scribbling this in a hurry to catch the mail. Your affectionate son, Jim.

Zeitoun, Cairo, Egypt, Author: James Joseph Makin Location: Zeitoun Cairo Egypt Date: 18 March 1916Nationality: Australian Text: 18/3/1916 Dearest Mother and Father, On coming in to the Y.M.C.A. tonight I heard that there is another mail for Australia closing tomorrow afternoon, so I am taking the chance of sending you another few lines. I sent you several cards and my diary last mail as well as fo two handkerchiefs for Ruby and Gertie, which I hope will reach you alright. I also sent two to Essie and a card to Harry. I have not had any letters so far, and I can assure you I am looking forward to some news. I bought some silk things last night in Heliopolis and posted them today in Cairo. I registered them, so they ought to reach you safely. The blue shawl, table centre, and cushion cover are for mother, and the white scarf for Ruby. The little handkerchief was put in when I was trying to get him to take off some discount. The things are brand new and you need not be afraid of any germs on them. The shawl is a good one and cost 1, the scarf 11/-, table centre 8/-, and the cushion cover 6/-. I am sure I have got good value, - as good as one can get in the shops at any rate. The stuff you buy in the streets may be cheaper but one knows nothing of its history. There is also more risk of being taken in. I have not had much opportunity of seeing the sights of Egypt since I last wrote. We always seem to be on some duty or other. This afternoon (Saturday) was the first chance I have had to go any where this week, and as we do not know how soon we may be leaving here, I went out to the Pyramids to see what everyone who has been in Egypt is expected to see. I was unfortunate in striking a very disagreeable afternoon. It was very windy and the dust was lifting off the desert in clouds. It rained slightly too whilst we were about to get our photos taken alongside the Sphinx. I am taken with three others, - two brothers named Matthews from Murchison and a friend of theirs. I hope they turn out alright. If they do, I shall send them along next mail. As I flew along in the electric tram towards the Pyramids I could not help thinking of Les and how often he must have made this trip during his four months at Mena. The irrigation along the Nile is wonderful. There are green crops as far as the eye can see on each side of the Mena Road. At the Terminus the Pyramid of Cheops looks a wonderful size. It is not merely built on level desert but on a high eminence compared with the very flat irrigation country between Mena and Cairo. From the high country around the Pyramids you can get a fine view of Mena Camp, where Les put in some strenuous weeks in training for Gallipoli and its rigors. I did not attempt to climb the Pyramid today. The sand was blinding and the wind strong. I contented myself with examining the Sphinx and the neighbouring underground temples. It would take too long to describe them or tell their history just now. I mean to make another visit, if possible, and climb the Pyramid. From the summit you can get a fine view of the irrigated lands on a fine day. I had my first ride on a camel this afternoon,-from the Sphinx to the tram at Mena. I am enjoying camp life at Zeitoun. Although we get very little spare time and plenty of guard duty, we are nevertheless contented. We do not know how soon we may leave Zeitoun for another camp or to the Canal. We have had a few very warm days and many cold nights. I have got a card acknowledging my enquiry for Les but no particulars yet of his location. I met a lad who was with him at Gallipoli. He tells me that it is 100 to 1 he will not come back to Egypt on account of its hot summer. I am glad for him but sorry not to see him. I must stop now as it is getting near closing time. With best love to all Your loving son Jim

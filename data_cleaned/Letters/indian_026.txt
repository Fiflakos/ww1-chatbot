Author: Yusaf Khan Brighton Date: 21 October 1915 Location: Urdu, France Nationality: Indian Text: Letter from Brighton,23 October 1915. From Hav. Yusaf Khan K.I.H (Brighton) to Rangri Ghulam Muhammad, 40th Pathans, France (Urdu, 21/10/15). I have heard that the 40th are under arrest, and that Havaldar Abbas and some others deserted to the Germans with a machine (gun). Is this true or false? It is a great disgrace to the regiment. Give my salaams to everyone from Subedar Gulodu down to the sweepers. (Letter passed) Recipient: Rangri Ghulam Muhammad

Am glad you are getting some of my letters. There is no sign of the parcel as yet, but I live in hopes. I have some very good news. Les will not be going back to France for at least another month. He has just written to tell me he has not got anyone to relieve him and does not expect anyone for at least a month. During the last few days I have seen Jack Richardson and Ron Gibson, both old U.H.S boys, and just arrived from Australia a few weeks ago. Jack is in camp near the town of Bedford and Ron is a Sgt. in the Ordnance Corps and is stationed in London for the present He is a military Staff Clerk in Melbourne, hence his stripes. You have got no idea how glad I was to see those boys. Wally Cosgriff called in to see me yesterday. He is over on leave from France and is just back from Scotland. He is Armourer S.Sgt in the 39th Bn; a good job. He is looking very fit and well. Bill O'Brien is working with him in the armoury and is keeping well. I am glad to hear Gordon Stirling got home alright. You might remember me to him and to Mrs. Stirling and the girls. I was ever so pleased to get Gertie's snap taken at Traralgon. She appears to be ever so big, and a bonny little girl. Lenore must be a bonzer little kid. She will think it is her birthday when Les and I get back. You did not say how you enjoyed your trip to Ballarat. I hope you had a good time. How is Auntie Kate taking the bad news about Alex. I am writing to her by this mail.I had a letter from Reg. Bennett yesterday. He was telling me about the celebration of Anzac Day. I think there is one of your letters missing because you have not mentioned Anzac Day. Today is American Independence Day and a great day it has been. King George and all the heads were at Stamford Bridge to witness a famous baseball match between teams chosen from the U.S. Army and Navy. It finished up in a big victory for the Navy. The Yanks are hustling some, now, and have 1,029,000 troops in France by now. 276,000 for the month of June was good going. The German offensive has been brought to a standstill, and in view of the Americans arriving "in big lumps" the situation is rather more cheering than for some months past. I went to the National Sporting Club last night. The Yanks have arranged a series of boxing events, known as the "American and British Empire Competitions." An Australian named Smith (just lobbed over) won the Middleweights, and another named Eugene was "runner up" in the Lghtweights, won by a former English champion, Seaman Hayes. This news will not be very interesting but I just write as things come into my head. I am lying on Putney Heath, and it is quite light enough to write at after 9pm. I must be getting home however as I must be up before 7 in the morning. I trust you are all enjoying the best health and keeping your spirits up to full height. Much love to all from Your affectionate son Jim

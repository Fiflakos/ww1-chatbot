Author: William Birdwood Location: On board S.S. Osmanieh Nationality: Australian Text: Have left Lemnos, & last night attempted toland at the arena, the scene of the 'big row',but the weather was too rough, & we had topospone the landing. We are now lying insecurity, awaiting better conditions, so that wemay carry on the disembarkation.I had a good reception from my old comradeswhen I came back, & quite a number expressed theirpleasure at seeing me back again, & in good health.Our Brigade Major was one, & asked very kindlyabout my wound, if there was any after effect, etc.If you remember, it was upon his office that Iwas hit. One man was killed last night aboardhere by stray shot.We could see the fire along the beach (where it cannotbe seen by Turks) & heard the firing quite plainlyas we lay in the cove.I suppose that we shall get ashore tonight -it cannot be done by day, unless by great lossof life, as the turks start shelling as soon aslanding parties start work.Shall write again later if possible with Love,Will.P.SCannot write to all so please forward news &love to Grandma & all at Home W.A.

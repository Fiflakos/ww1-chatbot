I am still confined to my bed,but my diarrhoea is quite better, but the Dr told methat he wants my temperature to come down a littlemore, & then he will allow me to get up. It keepsdown to normal for 4 or 5 days, & then suddenly takesit into its head to hop up to 99 Etc, & this narks me.Well, Ive seen cousin Harriet Cole. She came downfrom Gravesend last Sunday to see me, & a long distanceit is too (45 miles). She is a dear old soul, but isvery active. She resembles Mrs Algie somewhat, only ishardly so severe looking (if I can use the word) & is alsolike Mrs May in the face. She was awfully nice & kind& brought me eggs & sweets & told me all about her life& also about the rest of the family. Julia Roberts is tooold to come so far in this weather, & they tell methat they have a bed & room for me when I am readyto come, & Harriet is coming to fetch me. They havehad the Zeppelins down their way & just in the streetat the back of their premises, so they get a littleexcitement at times to break the monotony. Harriet seems to have had a pretty hard time of itall thro life, & has still Lucy (her brothers child) livingat her expense, & she has had her taught shorthandand typewriting, & is now in employment somewherein London. Anyhow Harriet is looking well & keepingwell, & she says that all at Home are well.I believe she has written to you. She asked meall about Will Johnson & Aunt Jessie, & told me allabout them whilst they were in London, & some of itis very funny.I had a cablegram despatched to yousoon after I arrived & I wondered if you got is alright, &hope it did not frighten you all.Several of our battery is in England & twoof them are in this hospital, but in different Wards.Nellie Wheelers brother has been wounded,& is in Hospital at BirminghamWell, what do you think of the Dardanellesnow, eh; A lovely mess that has been hasn't it, & atwhat a cost too. Enough to make the poor fellows turn intheir graves. Well, anyhow, Im very glad there is noAnzac to go back to, & I don't mind where they send meafter this. It was a terrible place to exist in. I had the honor of having the first gun ashorebut I am sorry for the one who had the last gun.The news only came out last night about thewithdrawl, so I am eagerly awaiting the news.Talking about the first gun ashore. Cousin Harrietsent me a Melbourne Age 25th October & in it I wassurprised to see that there had been a discussionas to who the honor belonged of landing the firstgun, & in the paper, was a letter from one of ourreturned men (Jack Barker) & he had written to saythat it was the 4th Battery & the the gun was incharge of the most popular & efficient Sergeant NormanEllsworth. I nearly fainted when I read it. Ishowed it to Harriet when she came down & shehad not seen it or knew anything about it. Isntit strange that it should be the very paper withmy name in it. Of course I cut the piece out & have it.I had the only gun & was the first ashoreof any battery on the Sunday 25th April. No othergun got into Action on the Peninsular on that Sunday(except mine) & the rest of our guns & those of otherbatteries came ashore next & succeeding days.True, a mountain (Indian) battery was onthe peninsular before me, but they are not calledfield guns.I am still on Fish diet & getting on great& the Red Cross people cater for all our wants I am going to the Chapel on Christmas morningto service, & am looking forward to going to a servicein St Pauls Cathedral and Westminster Abbeylater on. We are to get 6 weeks furlough on beingdischarged from Hospital (This is for Enterics, the othersick & wounded only get 14 days) & I'll have 35 orthereabouts to spend, as we are not allowed todraw anything whilst in Hospital, altho I have got2 in my belt, so am not broke; Of course wecan get out & go to Epsom every day & the nursesdont say anything (altho we are not supposed to go out)Well, how are you all at Home? HowI think of you all everyday, & long to see you all.Anyhow the day is not far off when thisconfounded War will be over & Ill be home again.[[??]] I say, what do you think of Vin Yardley; heis in England too. Apparently they would not have him atthe Peninsular at any price. He has a very bad name, buthow the deuce he got here, goodness only knows.Give my love to all at home & elsewhere & aspecial ration for dear Mab, George, Chas & Rupert & Floss& an extra special whack for your dear self fromYour loving sonNorman.P.S. Ive had no mail since September. N.

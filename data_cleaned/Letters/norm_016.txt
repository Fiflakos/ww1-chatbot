Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Date: 6 February 1915Location: Mena Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest Mother & all at HomeI suppose that you will besomewhat surprised to know that I have just had aspell of 5 days in the 1st Australian General Hospitalat Heliopolis (4 miles the other side of Cairo). Last Sundaywe had a visit of 2 Egyptian Friends to the Mess & theyinvited us to come into Cairo to tea with them, so withDowsett & Braithwaite, I went with them in their Car &as we had not been to Heliopolis before, the chauffeurran us out to there. My eyes felt a trifle sore allday, but as this is not unusual on account of the dust,I took little notice of it, but by the time we reachedHeliopolis, my eyes were almost completely closed & largequantities of matter was running from there & as theywere so painful, Braithwaite took me across to theHospital (just opposite) & here I was fortunate to meet DrJ.W. Barrett. (Occulist & Aurist) who had just arrivedwith the second contingent & he treated me immediately& gave me wonderful relief, but said he would keepme for a few days & told Braithwaite to inform ourcommanding officer of the fact. Well I was givena lovely hot bath & put to bed with clean sheets Etc& there I spent 5 lovely days amid pleasant surroundings. This hospital has only just opened that day & I hadthe distinction of being the first patient & didn't thenurses treat me well too. My word, Mum, the Australiangirls are the best after all, they treated metip-top & what do you think, a sister told me thatshe was born in Smeaton, Vic, her name isSister Anderson. Well this place was built as anHotel & cost 2 millions & it was intended to rivalMonte Carlo, but the Egyptian Govt would not grantthem a gambling liscence, & they tried to run it asa Hotel, but it failed this year, so the British Govtsnapped it as a hospital. It is a wonderfulplace & beautifully lit up & it costs 70 a nightfor electric lighting. It is the 2nd largest Hotel inthe world. Well my eyes used to be bathed every3 hours with boracic & drops put in & this gaveme wonderful relief. Dr Barrett is a gentlemen && is so nice & nothing gives him trouble & he can'tdo enough for his patients. He lives in Toorak.The nurses also waited on me day & night& couldn't do enough for me, & their one object is toserve their country. All the chaps at camp, especiallymy subsection, were astonished when they learntnext morning that I was in the Hospital, as I was on the 4 o'clock parade with them & yet I wasin the Hospital at 5.30 pm. The pain & inconveniencethat I suffered was completely compensated for bythe welcome that the boys gave me when I returnedto camp completely cured. It was some sort of Opthalmia& the Dr said that I probably contracted it from ahorse with a cold. We haven't had a "box on" yet withthe Turks, altho' the Victorian Infantry is down thereat the Canal doing well, but we hope to be theresoon. Mabs cigarettes arrived 2 days ago & in goodcondition & the boys send their heartiest thanks &good wishes to her for her kindness. How is Rupert.That is always on my mind at present, but somethingtells me he is alright now, anyhow, I hope so.The whole of the Divisional Artillery had theirphoto taken this morning & it was a fine sight & I'lltry & send you a Photo if I can. How is every body inMelbourne. I hope quite well. Give all kind enquirersmy best wishes, & my best love to all at Home.There is nothing much to tell you, as we are stilldoing the same kind of work, but we hope to get ashift soon. Well Mother, dear, I'll close now inorder to catch the Mail with best love & hoping allare well I am your loving son, Norman.

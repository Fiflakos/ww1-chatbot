Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 20 November 1917 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 20.11.1917 My dear mother,This is the first line I have attemptedto write for about 3 weeks since we started off on our expeditioninto Palestine which has so far gone very successfully. I cannothope to tell you very much just now, as we may move again at anymoment. Before I commence though, I met Jack abouttwo weeks ago in Beersheba when he was watering his mulesvery tired & dusty, but otherwise well. Preparations had ofcourse been made for weeks previously, of which I could tellyou nothing & finally we started off on our long march.The Mounted troops had to push away Southwards &somewhatWest through Khalasa & Asluj before turning North & lastto encircle Beersheba. We moved to Khalasa a coupleof days before the commencement of the scrap & on the nightbefore the battle marched all night - first through Asluj &then round in a Northerly direction in order to attack Beershebain flank & rear. I stopped at Asluj & got twelve MotorAmbulances together & set off at daylight next morningto catch up the troops. It was a terribly trying marchfor them - some 35 miles & no water to be had anywhere.I had considerable trouble with the cars as the roadswere merely goat tracks & we had to use shovels in places to make a road, but we eventuallyreached the troops about 10 a.m. next day. The Infantrywere attacking from the front & one of the Mounted Divisionsfrom the flank & rear. We were in reserve till later in the day& were able to watch the battle from a hill. It was as always,a fine spectacle, columns of our horsemen could be seenadvancing & then dismounting & attacking Tel el Saba, theirartillery pounding away at it to support them, sometimesalmost oblitering it with puffs of white shrapnel smoke& dust. Then the enemy artillery which was well servedopened on our men & horses & it seemed sometimes asif hardly any could escape when a shell burst rightamongst them. The attack attack was gradually pusheduntil the redoubt was taken, but still more redoubts &strong ones at that remained. A couple of Brigades fromour Division were then pushed in, as it was growing dark& one in particular which was led by Colonel Grantwho was my Colonel at Gallipoli did brilliant work.Seizing its opportunity, they advanced for some 2 or3 miles at the gallop so as to f get in before dark,& charged right at the Turkish trenches withsuch demoralizing effect that the Turks gavein & the town was ours. The Brigade took 1200prisoners & 9 guns & several machine guns. They had of course some stiff fighting before theyfinally conquered the place but they made no mistakeabout it. It was by this time dark & we atDivisional Headquarters were in doubt as to what hadhappened till finally the news came in.. The Turks hadbombed us from aeroplanes a good deal during the day& I was busy evacuating some wounded from one particularplace. I have never seen anything more horrible than aspot where a bomb had dropped among sometransport & had killed & wounded all the horses & menin the locality. To see fine pairs of horses lying deadin their harness as they dropped was horrible.We had established dressing stations for our wounded& when the news of the fall of Beersheba was knownI rushed in with 4 motor Ambulances & some woundedto take over the Turkish Hospital. I was stuckseveral times in bad ground & finally came to a deadend & was overtaken by Col Dixon who was ridingin. He located the hospital & showed me the way toit. It was situated in a fine building, hada staff of 5 doctors & 10 orderlies, a goodoperating theatre, beds mattresses & quilts toaccommodate some 300 patients - notall in the main building , but some in some long low wards at the rear. There was asplendid Pharmacy & Bacteriological Laboratorywith an Austrian Pathologist. The place was full of woundedTurks & in the wards at the back were numeroussick ones. As it was about 4 a m. I just had onesmall ward made ready for the patients I had brought& any others who might arrive & went to bed for acouple of hours in a Turkish bed. I rose at daylight& explored the place, found a stock of Turkish provisions& another fine building nearby also suitable for ahospital. I commenced to empty all the Turkishwounded out of the main building into the wardsat the rear & made ready to receive our ownwho had been housed in the Tent Divisions ofthe Ambulances during the night on the fieldof battle. I collected wood & water & madeready for the big rush we soon expected. About7.30 our operating ^motor car came along from Khalasait had been able to proceed by a main metalledroad direct as soon as the news came of thefall of Beersheba & was soon followed bya large composite Ambulance which hadbeen formed to act as a Clearing Station &came by the same route as the Motor Operating Theatre I handed over the place to them & soon afterwardswounded commenced to arrive & were treated in asplendid way - urgent operation done when requireddressings & hot drinks given & then evacuateddown by the direct main road to railheadby heavy motor Ambulances. If you look atthe way we went on our march it was somewhat like thisYou can see how far round we went & howmuch shorter our evacuation was onceBeersheba was taken.I did not mention how weird it was enteringBeersheba as I first did in the early hours ofthe morning in an Ambulance - buildings set onfire by the Turk were blazing freely & the moon wascasting a pale light on the buildings & relics ofbattle. Occasionally I met a guard of our men on some building but for the most part thetown was deserted & only an occasional dogor cat rushed across the road. I kept my handwell on my revolver in case of accidents as onenever knew what would turn up nextAfter handing over the hospital next day I joineddivisional headquarters again & we eventuallytook up our quarters in a building & were verycomfortable indeed as we had chairs & tables leftbehind by the Turks & lamps & many such smallaccessories to comfort. But there was much troublein watering the horses, as the Turks had blown in thewells & we had great difficulty in pumping up thewater as they had spoilt the engines also. So themen had a hard time getting watered & it was atsuch a time that I met Jack & we had quite along chat while we he was waiting for water & discussedhome & Australia etc etc. After another day or two wewere ordered to move back & waited behind anotherportion of the line near Sheria which the Infantrywere attacking This was a very strong positionbut the taking of Beersheba had exposedit's flank & it could be battered from bothsides & on this day, we sat on a hill behind the Infantry & watched our gunspound the place to pieces just in front ofthe attacking Infantry - the biggest bombardmentI have seen here. Gradually our shelling movedon & we could see that the Infantry had advanced& the shelling was now on the retreating Turk, itwas evident that he was driven out of hisstronghold. We received orders to advancesome few miles ready to follow on the retreatingTurk next morning. We camped by a prettylittle Wadi that night but set off about 2a.m.& marched on & on & got into contact withthe enemy about midday They commencedto shell us heavily with large & small gunsbut we replied & attacked & drove them off & aswe advanced on Huj we passed two big 5.9inch guns which our men had galloped onto & captured (my old Regt - 9th LH had got them).Later that day, the 5th Yeomanry Brigade partof this Division did a brilliant charge onhorseback with swords right in the face ofthe guns which were firing at them atpointblank range & although they lostseveral men & a lot of horses which were smashed up by artillery fire at about 40 yardsdistance, they sabred the gunners & captured9 field guns & 12 Machine guns. They were almostsurrounded themselves but with the aid of their machineguns which came up they drove off the Turks &retained their gains. That night we campedat Huj very tired & thirsty - water terribly scarcethe Turks had blown in the well at Huj. A tremendousdump of ammunition of all kinds was captured here &a big signal station & the ground everywhere wasstrewn with articles of equipment abandoned by theTurks in their haste - rifles swords belts spare partsmachine guns, ^field guns, dead oxen, tents, brokenwagons & good wagons, railway trucks at asmall branch line at Huj, in fact every possibleitem of army equipment you could imagineWe were now faced with a problem. We hada hundred sick & wounded to dispose of & wewere far from our base & still advancing-we must send them back. So we establisheda tent Subdivision at a place called Jemmamasome 4 miles N E of Huj where there was water& here I was left to get rid of thesepatients as best I could. Fortunately 7 of our motor Ambulances had now turned up& I had about 60 camels with cacolets forwounded. I sent some of these direct backto Sheria c Turkish wounded immediately &then collected all the rest at Jemmama &set off the same afternoon with the firstload for Sheria. I arrived there at dusk& it was then too late to return so I stayedthe night & set off again at daybreak. Iarranged to bring away all remaining seriouscases with me & for camels to bring the sick &slightly wounded & all Turks immediatelySo I went back to Sheria & there stolesome more petrol which was runningshort & as the hospital was now clearI ordered it to be closed & to collectat Huj & rendevouz there c camels& I set off in with couple of motorAmbulances to look for Division.This will finish this letter & I will continue latermy dear. Two letters of early September fromyou have arrived & other mail, Much love,hope you will soon be well settled. I am insplendid health & spirits & Your ever loving son, Wilf.

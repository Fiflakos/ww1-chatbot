Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Mena Camp Cairo Egypt Date: 19 December 1914 Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest Mother and all at Home & Relations Elsewhere.I have just received your letters from yourself & Mab &have read them through about 48 times, I can't describethe feeling it sent through me to get them either Wecan only feel sorry for those who don't get letters & theywalk away very disappointed & "Crack hardy", Well I amvery grateful for the letters & am very sorry to think thatI can't write to everybody I would like to, but hope youwill let everybody know that I am as busy as a Sergeant ofthe Artillery can only be. What with stables & Gun Drill& signalling & all kinds of Riding & Driving Drill gettingready for Kaiser Bill & Co, time is very scarce forwriting letters & Home must be first. We are quitesettled down in camp now & there must be 20,000 troopshere now & they are all getting into shape rapidly. Weget plenty to eat & drink & also plenty of clean clothes.The natives do all the dirty work & we live likelords of the Desert. The Arabs of the Desert havemagnificent ponies & the Officers & trying to get holdof some. We have fine big tents which are double& let a passage of air all around & even in thehottest time of the day, the tents are beautifully cold. You will be pleased to know that all the boys arein the best of health & send their best wishes to everybodyincluding Floss Robinson, who they can never forget.I am in the best of health & am positive that Ihave never felt better in my life & cannot expect toI am as frisky as a horse & am rapidly losingmy "bingy" as I can take up my belt to the fifthhole, whilst it was only the second hole at B'meadowsDon't laugh now please, we got orders thatno man is to shave his upper lip (Oh my) Fancyme with [[7?]] hairs under my nose (What oh).Cairo is still the same wicked place & I don'tgo in very much of a night (about once a week & amback in camp by 11 pm.) We are hiring a motor carto take 7 of us Sergeants all around the place to-morrow (Sunday) afternoon to see everything we can.This afternoon, we went to the Pyramids & wentto the top of one. Oh my word, Mum, talk aboutcliming stairs, stairs 4 feet high & the Pyramidwas 470 feet high, I was thinking of you when Iwas half way up. It takes 20 minutes to climbit, going all the time, & when we got to the top, whata sight we saw, it was well worth it, as thesight was one we will never forget. Towards Cairo, it was lovely & green & all cultivated & therivers & canals all running through the Arabsvillages was something beautiful & wonderful. On theother side was the Desert & the whole of an under-ground city that is being unearthed by an EnglishSyndicate & this goes to prove the mysteries of apeople who lived years o before Christ, all theplace is buried completely by the sand of theGreat Sahara Desert, & about the sand is sea shells& yet we are hundreds of miles from the Sea, on theother side we had a splendid view of the Camp & itwas a magnificent sight & the moving troops bdlooked like ants crawling along. We could see anArab funeral & burial from where we were. They makea holiday of it, & all the men & women from milesaround attend & the service last about 4 hours. Thewomen all keep up a peculiar wailing all the timeOn top of the Pyramid I carved the followingnames. M. Ellsworth. Mab Ellsworth, Flos Robinson,Rupert Ellsworth, Jack Tilton, Ruby Davidson, AliceButler, Nellie Wheeler, & a couple of others. So youcan tell your friends that your names are on thetop of the Pyramid of "Cheops" which is the tomb ofRamesis & some Ancient King & Queen. We went in side & it is simply marvellous, the outside stones areonly a covering to some of the most wonderful stonedressed by human hands. First, we had to takeoff our boots, because the floor is slanting & isof beautiful transparent Alabastine & is smootherthan marble, & we had to stoop going through theunderground passages & our guide told us allthe news & a few lies chucked in. We saw theactual place where Ramesis was laid & otherMummies, who have been removed to Museums.The walls of the vaults were of marble & Granite& each piece was over 16 feet long & 8 feet thick& 8 feet high & how they were got into positionsare only to make one wonder the more. Theceiling also was of massive granite pieces,beautifully dressed & goes to prove that the peoplewho built these Pyramids were cleverer than thepeople who live now-adays. Our Guide had a fightwith another guide over the tomb of Ramesis. Thefact is each guide was trying to talk the loudest& because our Chap won (he looked like the Caliph)the other spat at him, so our sport sailed into him& gave him two lovely right swings on to his jaw& then clutched him by the throat & nearly throttled him & it was only by our persuasions thathe desisted. In the midst of the fight, which wasconducted in candle light, Harry Braithwaitedisappeared with a fearful howl into a holein the floor about 3 feet deep. Of course he didn'tknow this, & thought that he was falling into thebowels of the Earth, however Braiths was soonpulled out & set on his feet again to his greatrelief. The tomb is divided off into two sections. Onefor the Kings & one for the Queens. The branches& passages run in all directions & some go up &some go down, but no matter where one goes, it isall wonderful. I will tell you the fuller detailswhen I come home. The Proclamation was readyesterday, but there was no military display, & thepopulation took things very quietly & beyond afew Union Jacks, there was no demonstrations whatever, altho' the people are pleased that the British areover them. Well Mother dear, I must now close asit is bed time. I do hope you are well & all at home& Charles & Ettie & family, George, Aunts & Uncles &Cousins, Jack Tilton, Rupert, Mab & Floss & "Gillie"& everybody, to make a long story short.

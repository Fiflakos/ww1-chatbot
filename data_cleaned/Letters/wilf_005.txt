Author: Wilfred Evans Nationality: Australian Text: A 63My dear mother,you will probably receive thisletter & the last together as the other is stillin my cabin. We are in port at presentwhere I am afraid that I can't tell youbut it's frightfully hot. We did notintend to call in anywhere but anunexpected wireless last night alteredour intentions & here we are for I don'tquite know how long - it may be aday or it may be a week. We hadgreat sport crossing the line - a largeswimming bath was rigged up in theforward hatch & there Neptunes courtwas held. One of the crew was dressedas Neptune, a big fine built man withlong hair made of rope yarn &Mrs Neptune's part was taken byone of the nurses. All the officers r Colonelincluded were the victims & we alldressed up for the occasion - I borroweda ladies bathing costume & accessoriesas being & suitable one for the occasion.The men gave us a preliminary ducking before the court was held & afterwardswe were brought before Neptune & hissatellites who were mainly members ofthe military police & were dressed up inall kinds of grotesque costumes mainlyfeminine. The colonel was charged &ducked first & was followed by theother officers The had a pail of flour& water with which to lather us & alarge flat piece of wood shaped likea razor for shaving. Graham wasamong the first & created amusingdiversions by seizing Neptunes beard& dragging another chap into the waterwith him. One man was charged withthrowing up the sponge - he hadbeen sea sick nearly all the time & an operation wasperformed on him for it's removal.I was charged with stealing soap onthe voyage to fill up the dimple in mychin & was sentenced to have it filled inpermanently on the spot which was done witha flour pill and water. One of the nurses wasbusy distributing flour & water pills to thevictims. One chap had to drink hisown medicine. Another who had beendoing a great deal of inoculation against typhoid was charged with annoyingeveryone by making their arms sore& was sentenced to inoculation himself& this was done by a large garden hosewhich was filled with sea water &squirted over his bare stomach.I managed to have a lively passageby grabbing Neptunes rod, & emptyingthe tin of flour and water over thehead of the man who was latheringme & was well ducked afterwards.We dressed up again next day &had our photos taken by various peoplewho had cameras. It was a very fineafternoons enjoyment & everyone took thejokes in good part. One officer dressedup as a blackfellow with false nose& wig & when summoned to appearclung to the top of the bridge & yelledout in black fellow fashion that hewas not guilty & would not go &had to be chased then escaped atthe right moment & was followed bya long line of dressed up men inchase. It was very funny - the bestpiece of the day. We had a dance at nightbut it was rather warm & I only had about three dances. We havehad a very pleasant trip & I am in very goodhealth & spirits, thought of you onSunday evening before tea singinghymns in the drawing room at Fairview& hoped that you were not too lonelyor anxious & depressed as all is wellwith us here. It is rumoured that wemay be able to cable for half rates towardthe end of the week & if we are stillhere I shall probably do so but if weare away by then shan't bother asit won't take so very long to finish thejourney. We have had one death on board,one of the Queensland Light Horse who hadmeningitis - his funeral was very impressive as inaddition to the burial at sea it was a militaryfuneral. The body was wrapped in a flag &carried by his comrades who were in full uniform- the chaplain read the burial services asthe body remained on planking at the sideof the ship ready to be committed to thedeep. All the troops were present, & officersin parade uniforms & nurses also. Thenafter the final solemn words were spokenthe body was let go & xx his own specialcomrades fired three resounding volleys over him & were marched back in silence totheir quarters. Everyone was visibly impressedby the ceremony. I have a walk up & downthe deck almost every day with thechaplain who is a very nice fellow, very Scotchbut as usuall very well versed in literatureWe have seen the usual sharks whalesporpoises & flying fish & have fortunatelybeen blessed with favorable head windswhich have been cool & f crossing theEquator I did not feel it at all hotnor indeed until yesterday. But atpresent we are certainly in a hot place& can expect nothing else, but even hereit is by no means unbearable. The troopsare in good condition & fairly healthy &in good spirits . At present we are besiegedby the usual black fellows in boats doingtheir best to make money by woking thepublic but the troops are equal tothem Must close now my dear withthe best of love to yourself & allthe Evans Thomas family hopingyou are all well & in good fettleas we are, fromYour loving sonWilf.I would like some good substantial war newsHeard some little bit today of a German cruiser being sunk by Submarine.

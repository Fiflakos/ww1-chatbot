However it is no good speculating now,and after all our sacrifices were not in vain. A Russianpublic speaker addressing a committee of workmen againstmaking a premature peace said, they must remember whatthey owed to us how many Gallant English British & Frenchsoldiers lay buried for our sakes in Gallipoli.I have been a good deal on the move of late, have visitedAthens and Corfu amongst other places _ Athens is muchas usual, you would not think there was a blockade on,Affairs are still most unsatisfactory in Greece and so farwe have all been pulling different ways _ I believe they are making an effort now to co-operate better butit seems to me they have got the wrong people out here todo it - At Corfu We had a conference of Admirals to tryand improve the escort & patrol services in theMediterranean, I put forward some proposals whichwere accepted by the Conference, but so far I do notknow how they have been received at home -At ' Salonica', from where I am writing this, we areattacking on the whole front which extends for about 200miles. The Principal British Attack is between Lake Doiranand the Vardar, as it is an extremely difficult job as it isall very mountainous & our men are not accustomed to hillfighting , so far we have been partially successful, but havelost a good many men, on the Struma, the right flankof which I am supporting with my monitor & blister cruisers,we are holding our own, but the fever season is beginning& I am afraid we shall have a lot of men down with itbefore long - on the other side of the Vardar & round MonistirThe French, Italians, Russians & Serbs & Greeks are continuallyattacking but are making very little head way - Monistiris still being bombarded - I suppose an attack on allpart of some General plan, otherwise I dont see whatGood They are unless the Russians & Romanians aregoing to make a good push when the Thaw sets in. However like you in France we are killing off Bulgars &Bosches - at the Dardanelles they have mounted someby guns & are trying to bombard me out of the straitsMines are of course being laid every where - after I hadarrived at Corfu they laid a line of mines to catch meon my way back, but fortunately I got wind of these& so came back another way - The Germans sent avery strong bombing squadron out here & they have been doinga lot of damage to the Hospitals & dumps at & round SalonicaAs the army machines were weak & not numerous I gotMilne to let me form a combined "Army & Navy" Squadronfighters & bombers and they have been very successful& have broken up the Eurwigs Squadron-I am now collecting up all the Generalist Troops fromall the Aegean Islands, We hope in the course of the nextfew weeks to make the Greek army up to 50 or 60-000Good, bad, & indifferent - We follow your movementsin France very closely and quite hope to see theGermans out of France this Summer- I think it iswonderful the way we turn them out of their trenches& dug outs and I can only hope that our losseswill continue to be small in comparison with those of the Germans - How you must all be lookingforward to the Summer after the dreadfully longcold muddy winter - I Presented some decorations &medals to our French allies yesterday for goodservice during the Dardanelles operation, I suppose it is ourAdmiralties way of doing things but it struck me asrather a long time after the event-I hope you will write to me again when you find timeI am always tremendously interested in all your doingson the Western front.with every good wish, and please give my kindestremembrances to any of my old friends andwishing that success & good luck will follow the Anzacswherever they goYours very Sincerely,Cecil F Thursby

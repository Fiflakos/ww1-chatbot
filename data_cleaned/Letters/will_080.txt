Author: H P Lynch Date: 17 April 1917 Nationality: British Text: 17th April, 1917My Dear Birdie.I am very glad you think theidea is a sound one- Your fellowshave had a very hard winter,_ harderthan most _ & ever since Feb 24ththey have had the lion's share of thefighting _ There is a lot more beforeus, & some of it will be of a veryserious type & your men are just thelot to do great work then, if they aredecently fresh & rested, so I am sureit will be a national asset if wecould give you even a few weekstraining & rest now-I think we can manage it, butperhaps it would be better not to wire toAustralia till we know how thesituation pans out.As things are at present, the VIICorps & the III Army are hopelesslysticky & God knows when they willcome on. I gather that the situationhas got very strained with G.H.Q.& I should not wonder if one ortwo gentlemen got a single ticket toEngland soon !Our attack on Sunday, at present,seems likely to be even further postponed !! If so, I think we would let youput in the 11th Divn & get the1st A.D. back.I am thinking that directly theattack is over (if Sunday, sayMonday or Tuesday) - your Staffcould drop back to Henencourt& Fanshawe would take over thewhole line. The III Armywould releive both the 62nd inHendecourt, & Smythe inReincourt, & the latter wouldgo back & rejoin you -Our next operation, would probably be anattack towards Moeuvres or towardsHavrincourt, & in either case, acouple of Divns would be all wewould employ. This could easilybe undertaken by the V Corps-After that , as we advanced onCambrai, - you would come inagain. But I think it wouldbe pretty nearly 4 weeks beforeall this would be done, whichwould give you all a goodishrest & change. These are onlyideas, but I hope they can be carried out..Yours ever.HP Lynch

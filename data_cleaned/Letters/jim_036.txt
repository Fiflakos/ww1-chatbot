Author: James Joseph Makins Location: France Date: 18 April 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Perce, Just a line to let you know I have not forgotten all about you. How are you getting on at school this year? I suppose you have started football by this time. The weather here is just the thing for football, but it so hard to play on account of the ground being sandy. We have had two matches and have won one of them. I got a tooth broken in the first and a tooth through my lip the second. Are you captain of your form team again this year? Kirkwood of Essendon is in my camp and enjoys his kick. Is there a School "Record" out yet. Don't forget to send one along to me. Mr Heathcote is in this camp now but I have not been lucky enough to strike him yet. He came from Egypt about 12 days after me. Jimmy Haddow is now a 2nd Lieut. and is with the 6th Batt. I think Billy Bruce is still at the Canal, but I am not certain. I had a letter from Les afew days ago. I was very glad to hear of him again. Don't forget to write now and then. Your brother, Jim {P.S. Do you still forget your lunch sometimes?}

Author: James Joseph Makin Location: FranceDate: 15 May 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France, 15/5/16. Dearest Mother & Father, There has been "nothing startling" since I wrote last week. There have not been any letters from Australia during the past week, and I am feeling the want of them a bit. I saw Mr. Heathcote yesterday and he showed me a letter from Perce dated 7/3/16 giving him all the news from school. Perce mentions, inter alia, that he had just written to me, but this also is "on the way". Tell Perce he Norman is well and was very pleased to get his letter. Jimmy Haddow got a commission in Egypt and is now with the 58th Battalion. One of the other chaps who used to be in the tent at Albert Park (he is now a Warrant Officer) was asking if he had seen Perce. Norman Heathcote said, "Don't you remember the little boy who used to bring over the hot scones and apple tarts." "My word I do", said Bromilow, "and I wish we had a few of them now. That was in the good old days". Then followed a eulogy of the apple tarts and of mother's good cooking. There is really not much to write about until I get a few letters from you. I have not had any letter from Les. since I last wrote, but I have another from Dr. Gibson. he says that he wrote to you telling you how Les. was getting on. I suppose you were comforted a bit by it. He is a very jolly chap indeed, and his letters cheer me up considerably. The weather has not been so fine lately and it is said that the month of May is usually showery in northern France. We do not know when we will move out of this Camp, but it should not be long now. We hear all sorts of rumours about the fighting, but it seems to me that the closer one is, the less chance you have of hearing anything reliable. I have sent a good few postcards the last couple of mails and hope they "landed" safely. Hoping to hear of you shortly, Your affectionate son, Jim.

The O.Cs of each companydo the censoring whether thereis any more I can't say.If they are going to treat us alwaysas they have lately with mailswe will be in for a good time.This is the third that has leftwithin a week.I have been sleeping in pyjamasfor a week & I found they takeas much getting used to as sleepingin your clothes.No mails yet.

Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: William Birdwood Date: 22 December 1915 Nationality: New Zealand Text: My dear General, Many thanks for your letter of the 29th October. Will you permit me to congratulate you and allassociated with you on the result of the withdrawal operationswhich we have just heard have been so successfully carried out?Our 2nd Hospital ship, the "Marama", left here onDecember 5th. I do not actually know what her destination willbe : I am rather in hopes that she will fetch up somewhere inyour locality, but the Imperial Authorities have been impressingupon me the necessity of having Hospital Ships to carry thewounded between Suez and New Zealand and between Suez andAustralia, and she may be detailed for that work, although Igather from what Cowans tells me that it will not debar herfrom going into the Mediterranean. After all, as one wasbound to put the Hospital Ships at the disposal of theImperial Government to use wherever they thought best, I didnot think it advisable to make too many stipulations, thoughI have asked, if it is found possible, that the Ships shouldbe used as far as practicable for the benefit of New Zealanders. I have also said that my Government would never agree to anyof the doctors, nurses, or personnel being taken off any of theShips.I am grateful to you for your remarks about thedefects of the "Maheno". Most of them I knew of before sheleft New Zealand, but if I had rectified them then, it wouldhave delayed the Ship, and at that time I felt that you wouldbe very glad to get her at Anzac as soon as possible.I superintended practically the whole of the fitting and equipmentof her myself, and any mistakes which were made I amquite prepared to take the blame for.I think you may take it for granted that the Dominionwill certainly be able to fulfil its obligations to providethe necessary quota of monthly reinforcements.We have just organized a new recruiting scheme, similar to thatwhich has been in force in Ireland under the auspices of theLord Lieutenant, and I am Patron of the new scheme here.It aims at interesting the whole community in keeping up aconstant stream of reinforcements. It also provides that themen required for the industries of the country are not to betaken, and, thirdly, it arranges that men are not to leave their employment until the time arrives when they are requiredto go into camp, so that as far as possible business shallnot be dislocated, especially as it is vitally importantthat we should maintain our efforts in the direction ofkeeping up the food supplies of the Armies of ourselves andour Allies in Europe.The 3rd and 4th Battalions of the New Zealand RifleBrigade of which I am Colonel will leave here in the courseof the next few weeks, and then you will have two New ZealandInfantry Brigades. Godley has chaffed me over all the "Jims"which he thinks that as a Rifleman I shall introduce into theRegiments. They are very harmless ones, and of course onecan hardly expect a Guardsman to have brains enough to competewith any of the "Black Hearts"! I think you will find,though, that the four Battalions will do credit to the namewhich their Imperial brethren bear. They are a good, wroughty,buggey lot, as every Rifleman should be.With every good wish for 1916,Yours sincerely, Liverpool

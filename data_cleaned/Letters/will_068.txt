Author: W E Peyton Date: 19 February 1917 Location: France Nationality: British Text: GENERAL HEAD QUARTERS,BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.19TH FEBRUARY, 1917.No. MS/H/ 4806.My dear GeneralWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant,the following is the correct position regarding the awardof Foreign decorations to British Officers & Men.Anyone is eligible for a decoration from each AlliedPower provided he is nominated by name by that Power.This is what you refer to as a "personal" decoration.No officer or man (excepting in the case of officersof the highest rank) may be proposed by the Commander-in-Chief for more than one decoration " out of a bag".Therefore, an officer or man may have one decorationon the nomination of the C-in-C, plus as many as he isnominated for by Allied Powers.The Montenegrin decorations were considered "personal"decorations.I have heard nothing about the French calling forfurther names.YoursWE PeytonLt-Gen. Sir W.R. BIRDWOOD,

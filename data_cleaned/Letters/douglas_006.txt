Text: My dear Mrs LennardIt is my painful task & it iswith regret & deepest sympathy that Ihave to inform you of poor Douglas's death.He died of wounds yesterday evening causedby a shell bursting in the gun pit of thegun that he was on. He was acting No 2on the seat & a mate on No. 3 seat was alsokilled & his sergeant wounded. It hasbeen a terrible blow to the battery as poorlittle Doug was a favourite with everyone& proved himself to be one of the bravestof the brave in the battery. It was hisdetermination, pluck & originality that wonsuch admiration from his comrades. I was sentfor as soon as it happened from my gun &was with him then until the last. His leftarm & leg were both broken & I think shockcaused him to go off easier. He was unconsciousthe last hour or so & it was only his determination& grand constitution that kept him alive so long.His last words "Tell them at home Loni that Idied bravely fighting on my gun'- July 18th 1915.To6.C. 8th BatteryThis is to report on the heroicconduct of the late Driver D.R. Lennardunder painful & pathetic conditions afterbeing wounded by the evening's shellon the 17th inst.Lennard was serving the Gun (being No 2)where he was wounded, and although heseemed to fully realise the seriousnessof his own wounds, he asked that othersbe attended to first, remarking-"Look after the Sergeant Sir, I'malright" and afterwards continued to showwonderful pluck & fortitude. One of hismany remark was (and this was characteristicof others) "Well lads, I'm gone. I feelmyself sinking - but by God you see I'mdying hard".Considering Sir, that such braveryshould come from a boy of 20 years of age and bearing in mind the painfulnature of his injuries - I feel thatI should be failing in my dutyif I neglected to place thesefacts before youP.M.

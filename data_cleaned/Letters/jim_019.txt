Author: James Joseph Makin Location: No 1 Command Depot Sutton VenyDate: 6 September 1918Nationality: Australian Text: My dearest Mother, The day after I last wrote to you I heard that Les had been wounded, but I have delayed writing on the offchance of finding out the nature of his wounds. He was wounded on 25/8, and shifted from the 61st. C.C.T. to the 8th General Hospital, Rouen on 31/8. I am expecting any day to hear he has been evacuated to England, and hope such will be the case before the 13th, when I go on four days leave to London. I was to have gone yesterday, but have delayed it a week on hearing the news. I daresay you know by now, and I sincerely hope you will not worry overmuch dear mother, and break down your health. I have been worried a great deal on your account, but of course I await definite news of misfortune before taking anything to heart. I always look at it in the light that it will mean a trip to Australia for a certainty, and hope his wounds will not prove too serious. I shall send you a cable from London next weekend, when I should have definite news about Les. I had a letter from him on the 20th 'Aug. and as I said in Ruby's letter, the fighting was pretty severe although our troops have done so well. I cannot help feeling sorry to think you will have the news about my returning to France about the time you hear of Les being wounded. It is just circumstance, and I trust you will prove as brave as you have always been, and rely on prayers. Up till now we have been very fortunate and there is no reason to think our luck is going to change. Things are running smoothly here, and my arm is alright again. I hope I shall have good news for you next mail, and will conclude with much love to all from Your affectionate son, Jim.

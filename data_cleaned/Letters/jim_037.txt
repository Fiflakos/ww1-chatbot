Author: James Joseph Makins Location: France Date: 29 April 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Mother, Just a few more lines to let you know that I am well and in good spirits. There has not been a mail out since last Tuesday week, so I have not written for about a fortnight. I am still in the same training camp and there is no prospect of moving for a while. I received your letter addressed to the "Warilda" (dated 11/2/16) on GoodFriday, but you see I have practically no news since I left. I should be anxious but for the fact that Les has told me that everything was alright when last he heard. Evidently he hears fairly regularly from you. I got a letter from him just a while ago (dated 23/4/16), the longest I have seenhim write at one time. I drew his story (or a bit of it) from him by writing a letter full of questions, some of which he answered. How modest he is, but what a brave chap! You must be proud of him, but if you heard some of his plain straight talk to me you would be doubly so. He is every inch a man, and if ever he had any faults, which after all are only human, he has purged himself hundred- fold on Gallipoli's deadly slopes. If ever I prove myself half the man he is I shall be satisfied. I am not speaking so much of him military service, (which has been finer than we have ever imagined), but of his manly qualities:- modesty, in the extreme, his patience in his many trials, (for did he ever complain throughout his campaign?) his steadfast devotion to duty, and consideration for our feelings at home during his months of peril. Add to these his recognition of the qualities of others. He is never tired of speaking of the good points of others and giving praise where it is due. He wrote to me the other day telling me that if ever I wanted anything at all, big or small, expensive or cheap, no matter what it was, he would send it. A friend of his, Captain Gibson, a doctor in the R.A.M.C. also wrote me a very nice, cheering letter. He was even more emphatic than Les in asking me just to name any want I have. Of course I am wanting nothing at present, only that my ordinary good luck and good health will continue, and that plenty of letters will shortly "come to light". Last Tuesday was Anzac Day, and believe me, dearest mother, you all have never been nearer to me than on that day. What a coincidence that it should have fallen on your birthday! What kind of an Easter have you spent? Very quiet, I should imagine, and I can understand that yourthoughts were often with us, - so far and yet so near. I can imagine Les. on Anzac Day thinking of you in among his numerous thoughts connected with the glorious landing. It was a quiet Easter for me, but very happy. Good Friday found us drilling as usual all day. The first Aust- mail was delivered in the evening, and although most of the letters were 9 or 10 weeks old they cheered us up somewhat. It rained, all day on the Saturday and we spent it within our tents. On Easter Sunday I went to Communion - along with Australians, "Scotties" and "Tommies" of most the English and Irish regiments in camp here. It was a most edifying sight to see the hall crowded out with soldiers, and all bent on the same mission, - making peace with God. I went to Benediction and Rosary in the evening. I was surprised at the way Benediction was sung by the soldiers (in Latin) and also the hymns to the accompaniment of the Club piano. Is it not deplorable that trouble has broken out in Ireland? It is astounding, in- asmuch as there are thousands of fine men in the Irish regiments here, who are moved by the highest sense of patriotism. Who can deny that these Irish regiments are not among the best of the British fighting units and are fighting to uphold British integrity and traditions? I have mixed with them for a month and I know their spirit. And yet they are having their honor and name filched away by a ruffian horde, blinded by long-past wrongs and kindled by German gold and influence. Let us hope that the trouble will be stamped out this time for good and all, as assuredly it will be, but at the expense of much needed lives at a critical moment. This is another instance illustrating the sameness of the "Keep-your-eye-on-Germany" Policy. Did you get a photo of Les and Dr Gibson? It is a fine photo of Les as we knew him at home, but he has lost some of the "condition" he had in other photos. I think there is a fine expression in his eyes. Perhaps I am more inclined to eulogise him on account of hearing of his exploits so recently, but nevertheless I cannot help feeling proud of him. I am writing to Papa this time - a separate letter- because there are things which I feel I can say to you each separately better than in one letter, and then, of course, you can read both just the same. I shall also try to find time to write to Ruby and dear little "Nickie" and Perce this time. Remember me to both Aunties and anyone interested in me,- also to Harry and Essie in case their letter miscarries. (You see I have already lost faith in the Post Offices here). I shall write again shortly, and give you some more news. It should be easier to write when I get some of your letters. Your affectionate son, Jim.

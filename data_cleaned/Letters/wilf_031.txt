Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 31 January 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Camp Heliopolis Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 9th Light Horse Regiment,Heliopolis,31. 1. 1916.My dear mother,The mail this week was rather disappointingas it brought me no letters but I fancy it was nota regular one but just a small batch, but onenquiring one night at the hospital if there wereany letters for me I was presented with your cablewhich gave me great distress of mind on accountof the needless anxiety you suffered. I knew thatthe illness of any officers from Gallipoli wasimmediately sent home but did not think thatsuch a trifling indisposition as mine would bedispatched or I should certainly have anticipatedthe cable from the military authorities by one of myown stating the facts. However I sent one the nextday (Saturday) & hope that you received it today(Monday) & that your anxiety is quite past as itcertainly would be if you could see me now, withmy large waist almost bursting ^away the top buttonof my trousers. We are now settled into the dullmonotony of camp life at the base, each dayvery like the former & we do not go about very much as we have seen most of the interestingspots of Cairo. But there were one or two verypleasant spots in this last week. Yesterdayafternoon I went in to see the Bryans ofwhom I have previously written, & spent aSunday afternoon & evening which remindedme very forcibly & pleasantly of many thatI have spent at home. I went there aboutfour oclock in time for afternoon tea. Theylive in a flat above the business premiseswhich is compact & cosy & very nicelyfurnished. The building is a tall one ofsome six stories, the lower two being occupiedby the business of the Bryans & the upper onesby several different families in flats whichare reached by a lift. The Bryans live onthe fourth floor & also possess the top roofwhich is flat & where they have a small roofgarden & have their breakfast & dinnerin summer as it is almost unbearable inthe hot evenings to sit inside. There waspresent at afternoon tea a Methodist Sister ofthe Rechabite Order, a woman of about fortywho has been engaged for many years inwork in the London slums & is now workingin connection with the Methodist Church here. She is a very pleasant faced woman of strongcharacter & very interesting in her conversationabout London & Manchester & their slums. Shehas worked a great deal among drunkardsfor whom she professes great affection. Wewent along to the American Mission at sixoclock & there I saw more people in mufti thanI have seen in Cairo. There was a sprinkling ofsoldiery but the civil population predominatedwhich is unusual here at present, a great manyof them were American woman wh engaged herein mission work, among the natives. They have schoolsI believe where they teach English & try & convert thenatives. I must confess that the pastor did notappeal to me very strongly, but there was a veryfine ^male quartette of Canadians from a hospitalhere. They sang one of Alexander's hymnsunaccompanied & sang it well. After church wewent back to dinner (Australian custom reversed) &we picked up a Welsh officer who is in private lifea Methodist parson. We sat down to a splendiddinner, soup, roast beef carved in English fashion& not in the beastly Egyptian way with potatoes& cauliflower then pudding of different kindsstewed fruit & blanc mange & steam pudding followed by nuts fruit & lollies. We thenadjourned to the sitting room & the fire (forthe evenings here are quite cool) & discussedtea & cigarettes. We had quite a lot moretalking & then I betook myself homewards.I was thinking quite a lot of you in church& of your Sunday evening in Candelo & feltquite sad to think how anxious you wouldbe as my cable would not reach you untiltoday & indeed you might not have ityet as we are some hours ahead of youas regards time. On Saturday nightWesley & I went to Choubra Hospital wheresome of the nurses we have known, arestationed. Wesley was particularly friendlyin a Platonic fashion with a Sister Wieldwho has recently become engaged to oneof the soldiers whom she knew well before &who seems a very nice fellow, & we wished tocongratulate her. She was a Prince Alfred girl& her example has been followed by anotherP.A. girl at the same hospital named Riordanso that we had double congratulationsto offer. We spent quite a pleasant evening with them there as a couple of otherswho had come over on the ship with us werealso there & it revived old memories of PrinceAlfred & our trip across. One of the girls isnamed Corkhill & she comes from Tilba Tilba& is a fi cousin of the Bates family there &is well acquainted with the Collins & many Begafolk. I forgot to mention that the Bryans werespeaking Welsh a little & mentioned manydreadful & unpronouncable places in Wales & Iwished from all my heart that father couldhave been there, he would have been in his elementwith Mr. Bryan who is such a fine old chap &is in the same line of business & very Welsh. Hesays "No" just the same as father does. They alsohappened to mention Aberaeron & Abarystwith& Miss Bryan was at school at the latter place.I rode all the way into Cairo on the day thatI sent your cable as it was a glorious day &I had my horse saddled & thought I wouldprefer it to the tram. I think my dear this isjust about all the news I have to tell you. Theweather, at present, is glorious - I do notwonder that English people come here for thewinter, the days are fine sunny & pleasantly warm & the nights quite cool. I wouldlike to go down to Luxor if I can manageit as one's stay in Egypt is not completewithout doing so & our adjutant ismoving in the matter so we may go soonin small parties, our Brigadier hasjust been & returned. Much loveto all the various branches of thefamily & with mother's usual sharefromHer loving son,Wilf.

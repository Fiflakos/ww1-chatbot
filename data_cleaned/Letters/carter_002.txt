I'd like to bringthe writer out here to sleep one night. In the earlymorning it seems to be almost freezing. The daysare warm but so far mild and pleasant - itis really a far more suitable training ground thanEngland would have been & besides we are within amile from the Pyramids. We are camped ina large valley just off the Nile Valley -on our right (Eastwards) is the fertile Nile valley, quitegreen & covered in places with dense palm growths.Westward the barren desert to the South are thePyramids. - - The Great Pyramid has beenswarming with soldiery (afternoons are free)It's quite a stiff climb & already we've had anaccident to a man in our batallion who fell from about the way up to the bottom. He will live, they think.but will have to be sent back to Australia.

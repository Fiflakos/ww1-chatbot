I received your letter of March 11.I am so sorry you didn't receive any letters for 3 weeksI posted one each week. I had a letter from Campbell &Jack O'Connell by the same mail. Campbell has written aletter I have not received.Chapman has been given a commission in the British ArmyHe was one of those recommended at Mena & is the onlyone in the brigade to get one.Quite a host of 'Land & Waters' has come along lately. Theyare remarkably interesting. I hope you have been ableto get hold of some.There is just a chance of No 19 reaching you about yourbirthday but I cant promiseThis will probably reach you on May 24 or thereaboutsI am sorry I can't offer you a better birthday letterbut I know you will understand.Nothing further has happened since I last wrote& things are going on as usual. We are getting our3 meals a day regularly & some of the benefits ofcivilization so I suppose there is nothing to complainabout. To-day we received a very welcome issue of lbeach of Capstan tobacco. I have quite a stock now.You may possibly receive some photos posted in Adelaide.Rhodes has sent some films home & asked his peopleto post one or two to you. This may possibly be the lastletter for a while so don't be disappointed if a mailor two misses you. Wishing you many happy returnsof the day With love from Tom.

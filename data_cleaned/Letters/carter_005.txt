Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Location: Mena Camp Date: 31 January 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Mena Camp, 31/1/1915.Dear Father & Mother, There is a crowd of men being sentback to Australia next week - they consist of two lots -those found medically unfit, & wasters - theformer in the majority. I recommended two wastersfrom my old Co to go back & both are going -- I went up to see Freff (Sister U. M. Carter.)yesterday She looks as well & happy as can be.We fixed up a very nice donkey ride excursion inthe evening which was just great. Freff supplied twoother nurses & I supplied 2 other officers. It was aperfect night - full moon - - - We went round theSphinx. the old thing was made to smile for usby the Arabs. This is done by turning a piece ofmagnesium wire close up under the head & theshadow thrown up makes the Sphinx appear to smile,

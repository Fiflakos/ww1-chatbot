Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Egypt to France Date: 5 June 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: TRIP From Egypt to France 1 Dear Father & Mother - It is nearly a fortnight since I last wrote, butowing to all mails out and in being stopped indefinitely, it hasperhaps been hardly worth writing, even if circumstances had allowed us time to write letters.Just a fortnight ago today our battn was started off in the new campaign, and as a unit was pulled out of the front line. I finished up on the extreme, right (near L.[[?]]) & had a front of nearly 4 miles. [[?]] did [[Hi.?]] broke it with the extra work he had to do there, the remnant was sent to me, & fine big upstanding dark bay mare - full of pace & life, I've decided to stick her. About a week ago we were relieved, my boys had to march about 13 miles to the Battn [[raid?]] [[?]], & there we were a few miles from the Canal. Next day we went for a 10 mile march on the road to get their feet steady. & then next day we packed up & proceeded to [[?]] to entrain. We bivouaced at the station that night. Left eary next morning for Alex, one of the longest troop train journey Ihave ever done, & we embarked later the same day. Next morning early we pushed out &have now been out 2 days. The boys were nearly flagged out for during the past 3 weeks they had had an extremely rough time, and many of them nearly broke down. I am very glad to [[see?]] 3 H.M.T. Arcadian5.6.16. the guts they showed then & on the desert marches. it did us good to see each platoon in step, the beat & their singing &marching chant - well it was great. Each platoon has a singster - singing made these marches much easier. The night we took the road to the Canal, & out of the dismal desert well - the boys were in tremendous high spirits simply yelled their songs, made the pace [[t/c?]] - so that we got into the station about an hour earlier than expected - after about 4 miles of marching. I've had to leave Harmony in Egypt. I am sorry to say. He got dysentery on top of the desert march & was sent straight to Hospital. He was very ill, so bad that he was taken away without the usual red tape [[ferma?]] & ordinary sick casualties - Harmony - on the day we left we got news that he was about again, but not well enough to come with us. He should join us in 2- or 3 weeks time - and I am keeping his place open in the Company. Our sea trip so far is most delightful - in this crowded but could be far worse, of course the usual precautions against [[?]] are adopted, life-[[boats?]] (or [["kalos"?]] as we boys quickly dubbed them) being generally warm, though it is extremely uncomfortable. The ship is fine, nice bright. The weather is very pleasant. You 5 [[?]] You can't imagine what a pleasure it is to have a [[real?]] meal. in a [[real?]] place with comfortable seats. no flies, no dust, no sand or grit. [[?] is any meat pitched out near the c/o of being off" [[?]] mine do we hear the old curses of the desert time - Our motto re Egypt & Sinai Prini is "no Regrets" and a good one it is. (I will write more later) (June 17th 16) It is marvellous the roudabout ways it takes nowadays to cross the Medit. I believe this N. W. sends countless instructions to transports, & very few minor detailing the course to be followed. Also (as there are about 5 ships in the convoy) all change their courses everyfive or six hundred yds so that it would be hard for a torpedo [[?]] to makeanything take accurate calculations from a [[?]]as to [[?]] rate, course, &c. we order to hit in.We passed around the N. of Crete, - a miserablemountainous island it [[locked?]] In fact - anythingpertainng to Greece is miserable, dirty, untidy, &dammed. the danger now (Adriatic) is not [[?]] -much from [[?]] as from minefields - undubtedlythe dammed Greeks had a hand in laying there, &if Greece is the [[?]] [[?]] country to the death with [[?]][[?]] the Aussies have a hand in dealing it out.The day before we left the Canal [[?]] a nice,[[panel?]] from [[?]] - every article [[?]] was accepted 11Henge Cotl t hrane it tith ane 21buring that afternion tue or three of us wend for anctor ride along a road which can right reured theanvon of Marseiller a met glonous tapThe trun containe tno or three fire churches onewe visited hitre Dame te ta sarde is in life of ahigh bluff, and has to be reached by mans of acog wheel railway.

The onein our billet, has two youngsters (her brother's children)to look after, as he was killed early in the war.The only males about are children, youths up to 17,& old men, some of the latter without an arm or aleg - old veterans of 1870.We are able to view the ravages of war, with anunbiassed mind at present - and war is a mostdevilish & hellish thing"S'ailly" Tuesday 20.6.16,I wasn't able to finish this note last Friday & thenext day we recd orders to move on here - about 9 13miles from Rouge x - a nice day's march.We are now reserves to the firing line & that is the 10thAlready I have seen many of the old boys, & youcan't imagine what reunions we have & will hold duringthe days in this district. At the end of the weakwe more up to the support lines - (billets still) - butright among shells & gas. The latter is a realfactor here - 3 gas alarms last week & severalcasualties too - on one occasion travelled over 10 milesArtillery & aerial torpedoes kick up hell's delight, & atnight machine guns bark till artillery shut them up.The country is low lying, trenches impossible, so onlybreastworks possible. I've seen Coffey & Minagall, & amintending to visit the front to see Weir, Giles &c. in a day or two.Well - I'm dog-tired so will close with best of all good wishes,much love, & hopes you are as well as Rollo.

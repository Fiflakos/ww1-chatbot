Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Anzac Cove EgyptDate: 11 November 1915 Text: 21st BirthdayWell according to the date I am entering mymanhood under extraordinary conditions - onActive Service & in the front firing line.I would of course have liked to be in S. Austand at home today - but when our nation isattacked by the dogs of war as she is today,I think I am absolutely in my right place.But all the same to think that this timelast year I was in the midst of serious FinalUniversity Exams., today in a fight for existencewhy then one realises what a chameleon kindof individual it is possible for a person to beI regret very much not being home todaybut I hope it will not be long before I'm thereagain. I think it will be a very joyous timethose 21 birthdays rolled into one.It must seem very unsatisfactory to youafter having brought me up - Educated me to,and then I rushed off at the very first chance -but then I know what you would have thoughtof me if I'd played the "stay at home". Iknow you wouldn't have thought it "Australian"I'm sorry I may not have the chance now torepay you to some extent - but that is not to be. One of my aims has ever been to avoid that typewho leave home & only think of enjoying themselves-I have always tried to consider 'home' first.& if God spares me I intend to do so yet formany years - until I have to a visible extentrepaid you for what you have done to me.You told me when I first went to 'S. Mines'to treat other folks mothers & sisters as I wouldhave my own treated' - & I have endeavoured todo so - & that rule linked with the Golden Ruleis the best "back-bone of life"I have tried to run straight - to keep mymind clean, my eyes open, & I don't thinkthere were many bends in my track - althoughof course I don't intend to pretend that I am perfect.On service one's language becomes weirdand wonderful - but circumstances alter cases-but any how I've tried to be a "clean sport"This letter is all jumbled up - but I hopeyou can make out what I'm trying to sayBest love & wishes for your happiness too,Rollo.

CENTURION,C/o G.P.O.9th June 1917.My dear GeneralIt was very nice of you to writeand congratulate me on the arrivalof the son - Many thanks - We wereall delighted to see your KCBin the Birthday Honours - tho weall said it was an outrage thatyou had not been given onelong before - Admiral de Robecksent me your most interestingaccount of the A.N.Z AC Corpsattack. It is a splendid storyand something to be very proudof. I am glad to say Carver isbusy given another Command andalso a DSO. His salvage of theMonitors guns off Smyrna wasa very fine gallant performance She was within range of a 6" batteryand constantly shelled - they livedin dug outs on an island andswam out to her working nakedmany hours at a time. When itwas dark lighters were taken toher and after a fortnight of strenuouseffort he [[salved?]] guns - shells-machinery etc. The Admiralty refusedto do anything for him because theysaid de Robecks mentions alreadyExceeded the Admiralty Scale!It seems difficult to settle limit mentionsfor gallant actions by Scale and unlessopportunities are similarly limited- a phrase which we worked into thelast letter - and which in the endbore fruit! Very many thanks for yourkind letter which my wife and I much appreciatedYour Ever Roger Keyes,

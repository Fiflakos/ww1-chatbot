Author: J W Kerr Date: 17 November 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: A" COMPANY,No. 4 Officer Cadet Battn.,NEW COLLEGEOXFORD.17/11/1917Dear General Birdwood,I have just noticedin the "Times" that youhave received, at last,well-earned promotion,and I hasten to congratulateyou.At the same time theparagraph was misleadingto me. It stated "aide-de-camp to the King." WhileI do not grudge His Majesty the benefit of your services,from the bottom of my heartI hope that the troops frommy beloved native land havenot lost you as their General.We have been under yourcommand too long - throughcloudless days of victory andamid the sombre trials ofdesperation - not to haveappreciated you to the full,and were we to learn thatyour elevation necessitatedtransferrence to other spheresthere would be, more especiallyamong those of us whosurvived the GallipoliCampaign and who werewith you through those trying months a deep-rootedfeeling of whole-souled regret.On the other hand thereare rumours (rumour fliesmore speedily in the rankand file of military circlesthan in any other theatreI know) that you aregoing to take charge ofoperations at Mesopotamiaor some other front. If suchis the case I would like tobe under your command.Although I am at presentundergoing a course here,with a view to promotion,I would cheerfully and willingly sacrifice theseprospects to serve under youin any capacity.Faithfully Yours,J.W. Kerr

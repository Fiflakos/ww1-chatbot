Author: James Joseph Makins Location: County of London War Hospital Epsom Surrey England Date: 10 August 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father, There is a mail closing here this evening for Melbourne, so I am giving you the latest news. I am glad to say I am feeling A1 now and am getting up tomorrow for a walk on the grounds. The hospital was formerly an Asylum, and it has splendid gardens, a sports ground, and a Concert hall. This part of Surrey is said to be very pretty. I shall be able to tell you more of this in a week or so's time. We are only 12 miles from London, which is now "out of bounds" to Australians. I have not heard from Les. since I came to England, but expect a letter any day now. He is back with his battalion, I think. I sent him my diary to England early in June, but I think he had left England before he got it. At any rate, he has not said he got it. I am very disheartened and do not feel much inclined to write these times. There has been a splendid runof weather over here, - no rain for about three weeks at least. It is very mild of. an evening here, and quite close indoors. The nurses are very kind and we get treated very well here. I am living on fish, eggs and pudding, so I ought to soon pick up alright. I am looking forward to some letters. I have written to France and given them my address here. The last mail I have is 30/5/16. I see a few Australian papers here now and then. There is really very little news to tell you just now. I shall write you a more interesting letter next week. Your affectionate son, Jim P.S. I have a lot of PICs to send Ruby and Gertie but have no envelopes large enough just now.

I amglad to hear you are allkeeping well. News isscarce except for the war, about which one can always write pages. I had a letter fromLes during the week.He is still down atWarminster and has nomarching orders up to now. Another Anzac Daytomorrow! How the time flies round. We arehaving a Church Paradein the morning, and a bit of a concert in theevening, - otherwise workas usual. I daresayLes will take partin a few celebrationsin camp. There is a footballmatch at Oxford nextSaturday against the cadetsin the officers' School. It should be a good wind upto the season. We havehad a very successfulseason, - about a dozenwins and two loseson very bad days whenit was anybody's game. I like my new jobin the Allotments Section.There is more work, butinteresting, and the timepasses quickly. Tonight's paper containsjust enough news to makeone impatient to see themorrow's paper. The Germanshave renewed their attacksin the hope of capturingAmiens. I hope theyget knocked back hardand often. The Naval forces madea very successful attackon Zeebrugge yesterday.This is the best news wehave had on sea formany months past. TheAustralians did very wellduring the recent heavyattacks in France, butdid not get much mention in the papers; until Haig's despatchcame out yesterdaypeople did not knowthey were even in thevicinity. They are nowmentioned amongst "thedivisions who save the day."There have been nomore men sent fromHeadquarters since the first week of the scare, and things appear to be going much as usual now. You need have no fearof me going back to France. I am here aslong as the war rolls onand a few months thereafter I am afraid. Well, I must close nowwith love to all at homefrom your affectionate son, Jim

Author: William Birdwood Location: Dardanelles Army TurkeyDate: 1 January 1916 Rank: Lueitenant General Nationality: Australian Text: My own darling Jeney Jane. Here we are at the beginning of another year. Where it willlead us? To peace after victory? I am a little doubtful of ourgetting through it so soon - that we are going to win I haven't the veryleast doubt, but I'm not at all sure if we will do so in this year. Youwill remember I always said Oct 16, as the end, but I'm doubtful if we shan't have to go on for yet another year. However, we may doit all right earlier. I am thinking of you all so much now& wondering what you are all doing - for again our mails have all disappeared. I have nothing from you since 30th Nov, & thosemissing mails have never arrived. I wonder if they will ever do so. I am again having a very anxious & physically trying timeof it with all this sea journeyings. I now have to carry out the evacuation of the Army Corps at Helles, & shall be really relieved once that is safely through. I can hardly hope for the complete success I had with Anzac & Suvla, as the Turks are very muchon the look out & will try to get at us all they can - but provided the weather is again kind to us & I have everyfaith in Providence - I am confident of doing it all right.Genl. Munro has now gone off to Egypt, so I am left alone hereto see this through, & when it is over I fancy I will go down to Egypt myself & reorganise my Army again, to meet the bigGerman-Turkish threatened invasion of Egypt. TheGermans now have their aeroplanes flying over our trenches at Helles, every day & night, while they keep shelling thebeaches regularly throughout the 24 hours, so we had to runthe gauntlet in landing & getting away every day, while the all embarking of all of kit, guns & animals is made amost difficult business. Only 2 nights a go a note inGerman was thrown into one of our trenches. "Your bully beefis not bad, but ours is better (referring evidently to some we had left & they had got from Anzac). When are you all leaving? Weshall meet again on the Suez Canal"!! and I daresay we will. My last four days have been rather strenuous. Two of them Ihave had to go down to Mudros & back - 60 miles each way - in a destroyer, & the other 2 I've been over to Helles. The first day to Mudros was nearly a bad one. I had warned the destroyer to be ready to take me off at 7 as had to be there early. They nevergot my signal, so I got on board & found them all practicallyasleep - a thing the Navy hate! Then to make up for lost timeonce they got steam up & we were off, we had to go 26 knots against a head wind. On deck I was all right thoughrather wet, but foolishly allowed myself to be tempted down into the ward room for breakfast! That was too much forme, as the whole place was simply jumping over itself!You could hardly stagger across it by holding on toeverything & nothing would remain on the table! SoI soon came on deck again & lay down in thechart room, when I was all right. Then coming back from Mudros last night we had a horrid time of it - we have to go without lights for fear of submarines,so it's never too easy to find one's way in here through theanti-torpedo nets. As we were getting near, the wretchedFrench battleship "Souffran" who had been out shelling some Turkish guns all day, came along & rammed & sankone of our horse ships, which made me extremely angry asshe was just going over to Helles to evacuate horses we wanted to get away badly. Then she used her searchlights to pick upthe crew etc, but these completely put our Captain out of his bearings, as we thought they came from a ship in harbour, &nearly went on the rocks accordingly! After wandering about for a bit, we finally had to anchor till we could find outwhere we were, & then started again on our wanderings toget in - rolling of course like the devil, all this time. HoweverI'm thankful to say we eventually got in all right at 9.30instead of 7 as we expected. Today again it has not been toopleasant - the worst part being the getting on board. There were real big seas rolling in & I had to go off in a verylight motor boat which was just chucked about allover the place, & real active gymnastics were requiredto get out of her onto the destroyer - however having managedthat, I climbed up on the bridge & was all right,though we had the same difficulties in getting on& off at Helles & again on returning home - & even now as I sit writing, I feel as if this whole table was rising & falling about me. I had quite an interesting day of it with the French whosetroops I am relieving today, so as not to have any muddlewith the two lots of troops on finally leaving, though Iam keeping their Artillery, or some of it to the last, but under our officers orders. I am glad to say I have been ableto arrange all of this most amicably with the little FrenchGeneral Brulard, who has become a great friend of mine& I quite enjoy an occasional dejeuner with him, though itmeans eating & drinking much too much. Today, I went over to present a Military Cross & some D.C. Medals to someFrench men, & was quite pleased with the small speech I made"Mon comerad, je suis trs heureux de remettre de lapart de mon Roi cette medaille - et je vous fait mesfelicitations, et c'est un grand honeur pour moi deserai le main d'un brave soldat Francais comme vous".I was told this was quite all right & was complimentedon my accent!! Not by the French who would have doneso out of politeness, but by the interpreters! It is about the only time I have broken out in French as in conversationI refuse to give myself away at all. Then after dejeuner, little Brulard made me a nicespeech saying he had just received a telegram from the President of the Republic saying he had approved ofmy appointment as a Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour.Rather nice, I think. Fortunately, perhaps the decoration had not arrived, & I was not kissed as I suppose wouldotherwise have been the case! With the French this is lookedupon as a tremendous thing & very high honour, & I fancy would beof use if we were in France at any time - if I could talk thelanguage! It corresponds to our K.C.B. Rather a nice silverstar, with a beautiful head of "The Republic" in the centre -and a cross are which one wears round the neck with a red ribbon. I shall have so many of these things soon I'llnot know what to do with them, Eh? I tell you what I wish you would do - at lunch Brulardbroke his little amber cigarette holder. Will you buy mea nice one & send it out for me to give him. I'm sure hewould appreciate it very much. & Quite a plain one ofamber - on the box case I'd like stamped "From W.R.B. to J.B" - or if it can be got on " mon ami leGeneral Brulard. W. G. Birdwood". The Turks began shelling a bit just as we were leaving andone big shell happened by the worst of luck to plumpright on to an unfortunate native transport driver who wassquatting close by & literally blew him into pices. Itlooked at first as if it had just landed into aheap of old kit, & it wasn't till the bits came down, we saw it was an unfortunate man, while a poor Tommy had hishead taken clean off. Do send this letter, or such as you like of it to your old Fatheras I have no time to write & this will give him all my newswhich I know he likes hearing - also do find out if he ever gotthe letters I write him telling him I would had spoken to Fitzgerald& Stour about Percy, & that they had promised to try & get him some further employment - my letter may have been in the captured mailbut I don't think it was. Has Percy yet got anything? I do hopehe has. Janey old Mrs Marker wrote me the other day to say their secondson was out here as a Pte in the Devon Yeomanry - jolly good of himI think to have come as such. I'd have looked him up, but thatI only got her letter a few days after they had gone to Egypt whereI may or may not see him. I have been so very sorry just to see the death of young Seton Rundin Townshend's fight near Bagdad. I fear Aleck & Daisy will be most frightfully cut up about it, as he was the one member of the generationcoming on of the family, to whom they looked & of whom theythought so much - he was like a son to them - & I know they will feel this terribly - do write to them about it. Goodbye my little one. I am thinking of you all so muchtoday & every day. I do hope you will have been spending aHappy New Year's day - sleeping well at nights - & I trustthat the coming year may bring you & all of us muchhappiness - and peace after victory. all my love to you - Ever your very loving old, Will.

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Harry,Sometime since I wrote to you - but I've beenrather busy lately. So you want to go to the Sch of Mines -Don't - if I were you I'd work hard for Jervis B or Duntroon.How are you getting on - in IV now ? Time you weremaking a mark in football or cricket - so go hard atthese games now. This is a pretty country - & with greengrass & ripening wheat everywhere it looks fine now.Women do all the work - no men except very old ones about.These are fine 'dogs' in this village - trained to pull carts.work churns &c. as well as to watch cows & sheep. To workthe churn the dog is put on a big round box fastened toan axle which works the churn by cogs. The dog has tokeep walking - & thus turning the wheel until he gets verytired. Look after dad & Mum receive love & bestwishes from your brotherRollo

Author: James Joseph Makin Location: France Date: 28 May 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France, 28/5/1916. Dear Perce, I have not had a letter from you yet but I know they are delayed somewhere. I met Mr Heathcote, and he had a letter from you dated 6/3/16. He was very glad you remembered him. I suppose you know Mr Langford by this. How did you get on in that swimming championship? I hope you had good luck. I am playing football here today, and am to captain my company against the Artillery. I am not sure that will we will not "get the cane" but we will at least "keep them busy". I suppose you are a much improved player this year, but mind don't forget to score well at the exams. as well as in matches! Love from Brother Jim.

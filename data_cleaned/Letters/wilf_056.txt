I have no envelopes butthey will put it in one for me at the base. Wemoved out about two weeks ago when theTurks made their attack on the Canal &after two or three lively scraps our divisiongave them a thorough defeat & we havefollowed hard on their heels. They havenow gone right back & we are now inno danger so don't worry at all. This regiment has done very well asin one day it alone captured over300 prisoners & another regimentwhich supported it brought thedays total for the Brigade to425 & 8 machine guns whichwas very good. We have had agood deal of hard riding & longdays but are now resting onour oars. I will give you a moredetailed account when I get somepaper & envelopes & will try & senda cable but don't see muchprospect as we are so far fromcable station. I am in excellenthealth so cheer up my dearI do hope you also arewell. Best of love to all& a double share for mother fromHer loving son,Wilf

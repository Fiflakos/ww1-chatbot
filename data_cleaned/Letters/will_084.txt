Author: W J Massey Date: 9 May 1917 Location: London Nationality: British Text: DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICESavoy Hotel, London.9th May, 1917.Dear General Birdwood:Very many thanks for your letter of the 5th instwhich I have received today. One of the regrets I feelin leaving England is that time has not permitted of my payinganother visit to France to see our brave boys who will, inall probability be hard at it again in the firing zone in thenear future. Had I had an opportunity of coming over I shouldhave had a very great pleasure in paying you a visit. However,it is impossible owing to the shortness of time which remainsuntil my setting out on my homeward journey.I am delighted to read of the success of theAustralians, and I know that you will always look back withpride to your association with the gallant lads of Australiaand from our own Dominion, in this great War.With all good wishes to yourself, and kindestregards.Believe me,Yours sincerely:W.J.

Author: Unknown Date: 23 October 1914 Location: India Office Whitehall S W Nationality: Indian Text: Dear Sir Edmund, Certain questions relating to the burial of Mahomedan soldiers have been brought to my notice by Col. Sharman and it has been suggested that a plot of land should be acquired at Woking and set apart for that purpose. I have discussed the matter with Col. Sharman and others, including the Imam of the Woking Mosque, who had an interview yesterday with Col. Lucas at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. I think the proposal is well calculated to meet and simplify all difficulties in regard to Moslem burials and to produce an excellent impression in India from a political point of view, apart from the sentimental or religious aspect of the question. It will be realised there that the Secretary of State for India and the War Office are doing all that is possible for the soldiers, who die for their Sovereign and their country. All that seems necessary is the possession of a couple of motor hearses in addition to a cemetery. Both Col. Lucas and Col. Sharman are of this opinion and I entirely agree with them. The Imam of the Mosque and the Muslim Colony at Woking which numbers about 20 or 25 souls are willing.

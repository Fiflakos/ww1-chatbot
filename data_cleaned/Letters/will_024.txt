Author: William Birdwood Location: Lone Pine Date: 9 August 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:My own darling girl,I have just got your letter of 28th July, while we arestill in the midst of the big fight I wrote & told you wewere to have when I last wrote. As I have just had to writean account of this, I think the best thing I can do is toenclose a copy of it as that will give you a prettygood idea - though it will not cover the great anxietyin which I now am about the final results - we were sonear complete success in our first night attack - GeneralShaw who has lately come to me in command of one of K'sNew Army Divisions & who is such a nice & good soldierwhom I met in S. Africa, told me after just not succeedingthat he had been trying to pick holes in the plans, buthad to confess that he thought everything possible hadbeen thought out & he could think of no other planwhich would have been nearly so likely to ensuresuccess. If only the Regts on my extreme left had beenable to shove on a bit more & reach the crest bydawn all would have been well & we should haveheld command of the Dardanelles beyond. Thenagain my second night attack, when I hadgot on to the ridge, two Brigades were beaten down by one unfortunate ship landing a series of hugeshells right among our men & inflicting heavylosses, as a result of which they retired & the Turksat once attacked them, making the whole attack a failure. And as you will see the Brigade I already had up there wasbeaten off the following night - leaving us in a most criticalposition, for I still have to take the hill & the Turks havehad lots of time to bring up their reinforcements - Theymust be in great numbers for we have killed I believeseveral thousands & yet they continue to come along & Imust say they are real brave fellows - you see while clumpsof them being blown up in the air by shells, but still theycome on and don't seem to mind their losses.Goodness knows how many of them we have killed,while my casualties are terribly sickening - it is oneof the most horrible & painful sights you can imagineto meet a constant stream of returning woundedmen from the front - some just hobbling - others beingcarried & all looking really much worse thanperhaps they are by being covered with blood,as of course there has been no time for washing. And we are in a very critical state I think -had I succeeded as I hoped & had General. Stopford's Army Corps succeeded as I hopedit would have done, we should between us haveheld a very fine position Commanding the Dardanelles& giving us a safe base - but we have neitherof us succeeded & though we will stick to it,for all we know, yet every day makes it harderas the Turks will be in greater strength & more dugin - and the issue can be no certainty yet awhile.I have told my boys they have to stick to it & see everything through & this they assure me they will do - andthey will fight as long as we have the strength todo so - and of course we will get reinforcements -but it all takes time.I can't think how it was that you didn't get one ofmy letters which I fear must have gone astray, asI have never missed writing. Angelsey has joined me& seems such a particularly nice fellow & all ourboys here on the staff have taken to him - at thesame time I have heard that the Chief is lettingme have de Crespigny & that he is now on hisway here from Aden - so for the time being Ishall have 3 ADC's, though Angelsey will probablynot stay for more than a couple of months - I believe he has partly come because that Mother-in-law ofhis the Duchess of Rutland has been starting stories about him thathe only came to Egypt to escape fighting & he wanted to prove thiswas not the case - As Sir Ian said, he would probably see morewith me in a week than with most people in some months, & alreadyhe has had to take his share of bullets coming along very close over hishead when I took him along round my left flank fighting, & yesterdaywe hadn't gone 10 yards when a big shell landed about 20 yards off. I wasrather amused as a new Battalion of the K. Army was just beside meat the time & 3 young soldiers promptly fell head over heels with fright!Not a very good augury, but it was probably the first they hadheard or seen coming near, & they just fell over their own feet ina perfectly useless panic - if the Gunners who fired could haveseen they most probably have thought they had hit them!These new Regts cannot at present touch my older hands.Now that de Crespigny is coming I cannot of course getReggie Sherston, though as he is already an A.D.C. I probably inany case would not have been able to do so.What a nuisance it is that Nancy has had to return from thehospital & I am so sorry about it, for I quite agree with youthat they will very soon get tired of her & say they cannot keep her on if she gets sick a second time.I am quite sorry you couldn't all go to Lady Robinson atBroadstairs, for it was most awfully kind of her to ask you& I daresay the change to the sea might have made you sleepall right - is it still too late to say you find you can go afterall? All my love little wife. Ever your very loving old, Will.

Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 18 August 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Syrian Desert Nationality: Australian Text: Syrian Desert18.8.1916My dear motherI am commencing a letterin the dusk & fear that I will be unableto finish it as we have no lamps here& it is practically dark already. Ireceived two letters from you yesterdaybrought out from our base camp byan officer who joined us. Surely themost romantic mail - received whilesitting under a palm tree with sandeverywhere except in the oasis. It wasvery welcome too as we were longing fornews. I must try & give you somedefinite account of our trip & willcommence from the beginningNext morningWe left Bally Bunion on 14 4.8.16 & travelledthrough Hill 70 to Duedah - I must senda map later with these places on, but Bally Bunionis about 15 miles north of Ismailia & Duedahabout 20 miles north again. Serapeum where wewere previously is 12 miles South of IsmailiaWe received only about an hours notice & sohad to hustle, could carry, waterproof sheet &blanket on horse, a days horse feed, waterbottle.& haversack on ourselves with day's rationsso we were fairly well laden. We arrived at Hill 70 about midday very hot & very thirsty& occupied some sheds there & had lunchmoving on again at 5:30pm to Duedahwhere we picketed the horses & dossed downin the open. We rose about 3am & pushedon. We went to Hod Bir-el-Nuss about 8 mileseast of Duedah & there watered ourhorses and rested. You will understand thatall through the country here are thesescattered palm groves & wells, water canalmost always be obtained among thepalm trees by digging a few feet'Bir' means well & "Hod" a depressionalmost always with a palm tree grove in it.We depend on these for obtaining water forthe horses on our way through the desert& so do the Turks. We had orders toattack the Turks at Bir el Amna butfound that they had departed whenwe advanced. Our news the previousnight was that the Turks had madea big attack on Romani to the Northof us & were repulsed & the New Zealanderson our left had attacked them & driventhem back also taking many prisoners.We then proceeded due East & it wasscorching fearfully hot & when weneared Bir el Hamisah our advanceguard came up with the enemy &shots were fired. Orders were immediately given to attack from thefront & sides & soon the fighting becamegeneral. I was in the rear with theColonel & after a while news came ofa wounded man on the left but on goinground found that he was bandagedup & could hardly be reached on accountof fire so gave orders for him to bebrought round when conditions weremore favorable as his wound wasnot serious. Then word came of woundedon right & went there, found one ofour chaps shot through liver & ingreat pain, bandaged him up &gave Morphia which relieved him buthis condition was hopeless &he died later. Then found severalwounded Turks & we made a kindof shelter for them from old oilsheets left by Turks & some sticks& bandaged them up, gave one ortwo Morphia & as much water aswe could spare for we had onlyvery little & they soon drank themost of it & wanted more. ThenWe also found several dead Turkshere & a lot of rifles & equipmentleft behind by them then wentfurther on & attended to one of ourown wounded. The fight wasmoving on & prisoners were comingin quickly & in large numbersOur artillery now came up & openedfire but shortly afterwards the Turkscommenced to reply with highexplosives from a 6 inch howitzer& the Brigadier decided to withdrawfor the day. Just at this time ourmen had captured or destroyed8 machine guns but were beingheavily shelled although they werefortunate enough to escape damage from shellsWe then returned for the night with ourprisoners 425 in all to a hod nearby & glad we were to get there as thefight commenced at midday &continued until 5 o'clock in this burningtropical heat. Men & horses were verytired & suffered greatly from thirstI had to change horses as minewas completely exhausted. Wewatered horses in the hod & made sometea & then saddled up again & wentabout 2 miles further back to campin the desert & we just flopped downin the sand & fell fast asleep. Nextday our regiment were sent back alittle to water but we found none &had to return about six miles to the hod we had watered in the previousnight to obtain any. It was aboutten o'clock when we arrived there &the sun for the previous 3 hours hadseemed like a furnace. We then madetea from the brackish well water(small quantities of fresh had beensent out by camel convoy but wewanted to reserve this for our water bottles.That afternoon we set out againeastward & the character of the desertchanged rather - it had previouslybeen fairly level but it now becamemore hilly with numerous sand duneseverywhere. As we ascended we couldsee Katia to a few miles to our North& the distant trees in the vicinity of thecanal away to the west. Wecamped that night at a hod calledSagia in the midst of the dunes& a it was a very nice one too. All of thehods have much the same characters- a large steep hill of stand sand onone side generally the west & then inthe depression a number of palmtrees leading on to an open plain ofsand beyond. We spent the nighthere & rose as usual at about 2.30a.m.watered & fed horses & pushed on. We had some difficulty in findingthe next hod & spent two hourssitting on the burning sand at middaytrying to find shade under our horsesuntil it was found & then we tookrefuge there & fed & watered againNo sign of Turks all this time exceptfootprints generally bare. Nextmorning up again at 2.30. & wetrekked on passing on our way somevery interesting old ruins with consistingof old pillars of stone brokin off atthe base & made of cement & oneportion more intact than the restwhich had been occupied byBedouins. What it representedI have no idea but it was veryinteresting to light on it thus. Onthis day one of the other three regimentsin the Brigade were advance guard& came up with the Turks & hada fairly sharp engagement. Wewere in support & were fairly heavilyshelled during the day. We relievedthe leading regiment that afternoonbut it was mainly a case of sniping& no one was hit. That nightthe Turks slipped away again& next morning at 2.30 a.m we were up again & on their trail. Wedid not see them until the next daywhen the leading regiment bumpedup against them again & hadhard fighting all day & our own regimentwent up bit by bit to supportthem. Our casualties were theheaviest that day past that weexperienced as some of the fightingwas severe. W The Turks hada very strong position on the topof a commanding hill whichthey had entrenched but theymust have lost very heavily.I was with our artillery observeronce & through the glasses couldsee the Turks returning up a hill& our shrapnel bursting amongstthem as they went & following themup under the directions of thisofficer. At nightfall the other regimentswent back to the hod at the rear &we remained to hold our position & nextmorning reconnoitered the redoubtagain & found it still stronglyheld. We were relieved that night& went back to the hod at the rearwith the promise of a days spell nextday but instead rose as usual at3 a.m. & went to the front where it had been found that the Turks had evacuatedthe redoubt in the night & wepressed on in pursuit. We went asfar almost as far as Hod Salmana& discovered the enemies rearguardagain. We made a demonstration &were successful in drawing anunpleasantly well directed shell firewhich was apparently our purposebut fortunately no one was hit. Ourguns replied & bodies of the enemymounted on camels could be seenretiring in the distance over the hills onthe horizon. Our object had apparentlybeen accomplished now as there ispractically no water beyond this partbefore the Turkish base at El Mazabetween here & El Arish & about 20miles away & once the Turks weredriven over this it would apparentlybe difficult for them to pass it again.The last Turkish position wasadmirably chosen as I said before & wefound behind it an abundant watesupply in several good oases & theyb seemed to have been fairly comfortablefor they had brought goats & sheepwith them & cases of wine werefound as they are a not so destituteas were are led to believe. We have now settled down here for a whilejust to watch & wait but I don'tthink there is much chance oftheir returning. We are glad to restfor awhile as men & horses werealmost exhausted after such ahard time rising at 3 a.m. afteronly 3 - 5 hours sleep & spendingall day in the blazing Eastern sunwithout shelter. We are under coverof the palms here but sleep on thehigh ground at night - waterproofsheet underneath, blanket on top& haversack for pillow so we arequite campaigners. We obtain ourprovisions & water by camel convoy& feed fairly well. I am in goodcondition & eat well. My lettersmay be a little irregular as thereis no postal service yet, but Iam seizing an opportunity to sendthis back as before, Goodbye forpresent & best love - I dohope Sandra is quite well by this& you yourself in good healthwith a hugfromWilf.

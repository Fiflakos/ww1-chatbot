Fortunatelywe had a few fine days between times, but it commencedagain this morning & has been raining fairly well eversince & tomorrow we move camp which is a disgustingthing in wet weather. Since I last wrote to you we haven'tdone very much, though we moved our line forwarda mile or two in conjunction with a big attack on theright which gave the Turks a bad knock againThey launched an attack on Jerusalem apparentlyjust as we were going to attack them & our attackcaught them in flank while they were throwingthemselves away on our people in their front whogave them beans I believe. Result Turkey hasgone back a few more miles & has lost somegood positions. Just at present our people here seemto do just what they like with him & I think hissoldiers are getting a bit fed up with things ingeneral & no wonder.The country we advanced over was rougher than everone would think it impassable from lookingat it & so it is unless one winds about in the valleys & gradually reaches one's objective by acircuitous route.I had a letter this week from Mrs Job & one from MrsBuchanan - mother of a fellow who was in myyear & who was in Cairo for a short period acouple of years ago - congratulating me on mypromotion, said she saw my photo in theSydney Mail, however it got there I can'timagine. I wonder how you are getting onabout this moving of yours & your settling downsomewhere else. It must be very difficult indeedfor you at present & I wish I could be of someuse, but can't very well be so, away over here.I was very sorry indeed to read of D Hunt's deathwhat a blow it must have been to his mother& sister, he seemed to be the only boy in the family.I must tell you of a joke against one of ourofficers who went to Jerusalem - you knowthat when operations are on & generally for sometime afterwards we live largely on 'bully beef' thatis tinned meat & biscuits - big hard ones.Well this officer went to Jerusalem & stayedfor lunch at the German Hotel Fast where we had so much difficulty in obtaining food Hegreatly admired the luxuriousness of the placewith fine comfortable chairs & sat himself downin the beautiful dining room to a table coveredwith a splendid white damask cloth, with goodcutlery, flowers in vases etc. While waiting forhis food he sat back with a contented sighthinking how good it was, & what a treat tohave a change from "bully & biscuits".Eventually the waiter came along with a silver tray& shiny dish cover over a plate & with a veritablesnort of satisfaction the officer lifted the cover &discovered bully beef!!!It is truly the Hotel Fast at presentNo more news this time I fear mother my dearso much close with best of love & an extra hugfor mother fromHer loving sonWilf

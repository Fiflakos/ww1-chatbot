Author: Guy Arnold Date: 5 February 1916 Location: Tel - El - Kibir Regiment: 2nd Battalion 1st Infantry Brigade Nationality: Australian Text: 5 February 1916Stationed at Tel - El - Kibir.My dear Father,I have not heard fromyou, for quite a long time; I had aletter from Aunty the other day sayingyou had the offer of a post, as bailiff underSir Francis Burdett, but she did not saywhether you had accepted it or not.We had a photograph of the whole batalliontaken the other day; if they turn out alrightwill send you one on.We are not having a bad time of it herenow, they have knocked off the afternoon drill,we go out from eight o'clock to about halfpast twelve, & then we have finished forthey day.I told you in my last letter thatJim Watts was in our Batallion, he joinedus with the 9th reinforcements; I have notyet heard what batallion Rupert has joined up with.We had some very heavy rain here lastnight, they say it never rains in Egypt,but we have had a fair amount of itsince we have been here this last time.We had hard work to keep our tentsup, after the ground got a bit wet, thesand won't hold the pegs, when it is wet.I wonder when this attack on the Canalis coming off; I think they mean to havea pretty determined go for it very soonnow; I don't think they will leave itmuch later, if they can help it, because itgets so terribly hot here, & water will betheir greatest drawback. Personally I don't thinkthey hold a ghost of a chance of ever breakingour lines; they have taken on too big acontract of getting too many heavy guns acrosssuch a space of country; I think one heavybattle will just about settle the Canal business;& then I suppose we will have to give ahand at Salonika, perhaps.Did Ralph ^brother get his Commission?

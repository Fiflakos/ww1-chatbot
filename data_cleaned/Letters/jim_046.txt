Author: James Joseph Makin Location: At sea nearing Fremantle Date: 14 February 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father, In case you do not get my diary, which I am posting at Fremantle to avoid censorship, I am sending you these few lines. I am enjoying the trip pretty well so far and the weather has been good on the whole. I am sure of getting ashore at Fremantle as I have been chosen for a Military Patrol to remain ashore after the others are due back and pick up the stragglers. A day on shore will break the monotony of the boat which is sure to increase, as we have 3 or 4 more weeks to go yet. I have not seen a paper since last Monday and feel a bit hungry for war news, but I daresay we will get used to it. We expect to reach Fremantle this afternoon or this evening and get off tomorrow. I suppose you thought the note I sent from Adelaide very rough but it was written at the last moment. I had been seasick and could not write until the morning we arrived there. I cannot give you much more news than is on the diary; indeed it is hard to find any to write at all. After I leave Fremantle all my letters will be censored and news will be scanty. Letters are not to contain the following :- Names and places of dispatch, Names of escort, Number & description of troops, Disposition of forces, Route and Ports of call, Criticism judged harmful, Reference to larger units or commanders, Ships met on route, &c e&c I may not get an opportunity, therefore, to send anymore instalments of the diary for some time, unless by someone returning from Egypt. I got paid 35/-, that is, up till 7/2/16; so you should get 24/- up till 15/2/16. We expect to be vaccinated any day now. I have not drunk a cup of tea since I came on board; I cannot stand it at all. I am sending a postcard of the "Warilda" with this letter. Give my kind regards to Harry and Essie. They can read the diary and it will save me writing a separate letter. Do not let any of the pages go astray; it would be better to put a fastener through them. I hope you made a satisfactory explanation to Auntie Kate about not letting her know when the transport was to go out. I have got to write to Sheehan's yet and explain. I must now conclude this ragtime letter as I am stuck for something to say. I will promise you something better next time. Your affectionate son, Jim

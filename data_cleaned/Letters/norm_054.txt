Author: Norman Griffiths EllsworthLocation: BelgiumDate: 3 August 1917 Nationality: Australian Text:My dearest Aunt & Mabel.My heart is just breakingsince the news reached me that our dearbrave soldier boy has paid the price.You will know the news long before thisreaches you, for I have sent to Englandto arrange for a cable to get thro' to you atonce, goodness knows how long it will be beforeyou hear officially, for there have been manycasualties this past week.- I felt I mustsend it to Dad for him to break the news toyou, for I can just understand what it isgoing to mean to you, you poor darlingsYou have no idea how I feel awayover here, since I've lost both Jack &Norman & Stew McGowan whom I lovedlike a brother, it is almost more than Ican bear when I think, I just have towork on & forget my personal sorrows.I am finding it terribly hard toconcentrate my thoughts sufficiently towrite to you to-night, for I have not recovered from the shock the news gave me,but I feel I must not lose any time writingto you, for you have to wait so long for news.Sgt: Braithwaite called here to see me lastnight, I had written to Norm telling him I wasright up near him, & the letter arrived atthe battery two days after he was wounded.So. Sgt:B. opened it to get my address, forhe had written to me, but didn't know whereto address it, & he brought both letters to me.He told me poor Norm was wounded justafter they had advanced with the gunsat 7.30 a.m on Sunday July 31st , & thedear boy only lived a few hours, for hedied at 3 p.m. A shell burst killing several& wounding others, poor old Norman wasvery severely wounded, he was given aninjection of morphia to deaden all the pain,but the shock would cause unconsciousness& he was carried to the 96th Field Ambulancedressing staion, & was unsconscious when hearrived there, & remained like that till he diedit is my one comfort to know he did notfeel his sufferings, & you must try & bethankful for that also, seeing he lingered for a few hours, & not conscious of any painis something to know, when one sees as muchof it as I do, it is greatest relief to my mind,altho' one longs for a last word or messageI would sooner a thousand times do without itthan know the precious words were spoken in pain.The hardest part for me is to think he couldhave called to see me himself last night, hadhe been living, for they came out of the linethat evening & were only camped 2 miles awaybut I have his grave quite near me Auntdear, & I am going to have it done up, theboys are erecting a cross. Sgt B. told me, thenI will have an official photograph taken ofit for you, that can be done by writing toEngland I believe, however I am makingevery enquiry, & everything possible I can dofor you all, that I know you would likedone for you dear one so far from home, I willdo, I asked the Padre here, if he would go over& make all enquiries for me at the Field Amb:that Norm was taken to, & get all hispersonal belongings, but they could not tellhim very much, as the poor dear was neverconscious at all there, but they gave a listof the things that he had on him, but, they had been sent on to the Base, so I've writtenthere to-night for them, & I want to know ifyou would like me to chance sending them toyou, or would you like me to hold them forawhile, I know how you would value everything& would not like to lose them, so I will waituntil you can write & tell me, it is of no usecabling, for I never got the one mother sent,unless you could cable thro' the Red Cross, youcould enquire if you would like to do so.I will give you a list of the things Normanhad on him at the time, but of course I havenot got them yet, I am only hoping I willclaim them in time, I am only two days behind.I will tell you exactly what I can havedone to mark the spot which holds our lovedone, & when we get the photo taken, you willsee for yourself, & if you want anythingmore done, I will send you instructionshow you can have it fixed up, but just yetI cannot give you many details, for I haven'thad time to find out all yet. I am goingacross to the grave, the Chaplin is taking metomorrow the first opportunity, at presentthe weather is atrocious, raining every day& mud it is awful, & they want me to wait until the headstone is up, which willtake a couple of days, but I am just achingto see the spot, & put some flowers there, ifdear old Norm only could know I was herewith him:- The day he died I was sent here& arrived at 7-30 that night (Sunday July 31stjust about 4 hrs after he passed away.but of course I did not know anything of it until Aug 2nd when B/ called& only two miles away, but we were allsent further back for the Germans wereshelling a village not far away, & theshells were whizzing over our heads, wedid not return until the following TuesdayAug 2nd.I cannot tell you just where I am inBelgium, but we are right up where thenoises never cease, & the gun fire is terrific.Norman is buried at a place called"Diekebusch" near Ypres, & his burial recordis Sheet 28 - H27-C.2.4Plot 1Row AGrave 19I really don't know what the Sheet 28 means or H 27.C.2.4.but you had better copy it all out forreference at any time, it probably issomething to do with the military, I willfind out, & tell you later, the gravesare well cared for, & kept very nicely I do hope this letter reaches you alright, Iwill write and tell you everything as I hearmyself, & please dear ones tell them at homeif I don't write to them also, they will knowit is because I can't manage it, & yourletters will do for home as well, for thework in a casualty clearing station upnear the line is very different to a Base hosp:& we have to nurse most of our caseson stretchers on the floor, so imagine howif our backs feel at the end of a long day.I do not think I can tell you any moreto-night, my brain won't work any longer& I'm too tired for anything, I never slept onewink all last night. I feel worn out withsorrow at our loss, & for you poor dearsat home, but do try & be a soldiersbrave mother dear Aunt, it is hard I know& my heart aches for you, but we have tobear these sorrows, I have met many caseswhere a poor mother has lost every son &as many as five & six of one family, &you have two left to you yet, dear Aunt.& now I really must conclude words arepoor comfort I know, the boys of thebattery will all be writing to you also Isuppose. My fondest love & deepest sympathy toone & all. from your affect: neice May (over P.S. There is one thing I forgot tomention, I sent Norm a parcel ofwarm clothes & put a tin of peaches& cream in it, I asked Sgt.Braithif he know it arrived, & he saidmy peaches & cream was the lastfeed dear old Norm had, for theparcel only arrived the evening before.You knew I rec: a p.c. from Jack written May 29th he did notsay much, but said he was well. I am not telling him that wehave lost Norm, the poor old boywould feel it too much I am afraidfor they were so fond of one another. Address.c/o Aust: Base: P.O.Mt PleasantLondonEng.No 3. Aust: C.C.S.

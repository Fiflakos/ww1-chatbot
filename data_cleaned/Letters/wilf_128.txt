Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 10 October 1918 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Damascus Nationality: Australian Text: 10. 10. 1918.My dear mother,I haven't written you a line sinceoperations commenced, simply because I havebeen too busy & now I just want to scratchyou a small note to say that I am well& everything is O.K. This is written from Damascuswhich sounds rather romantic but I'mvery disappointed with the famous city asI find it a beastly dirty, not to say verminouscity. We have had a wonderful experience thistime - talk of prisoners I'm fed up with thesight of them we have taken so many.One lot of about 15000 marched nearly100 miles to get away from us & we caughtthem in Damascus just about half deadthey had walked & walked practically withoutfood & were just about dropping & didn'toffer any resistance at all. I will settle down later & tell you all about my experiencesbut I'm rather tired tonight & just wantedto write you a small scrawl.Jack is quite a long way from meat present - haven't seen him at allduring operations. I haven't hadany news of that boat & my triphome just yet - we are all too busynow. At any rate it was a goodstunt to have been on & I hope agood one to finish up with as I wantto get home & see you now.Lots of love & hugsfromYour loving son,Wilf.

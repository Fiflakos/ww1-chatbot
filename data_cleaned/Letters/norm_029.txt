Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba TepeDate: 18 May 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: 18th May 1915Gaba TepeMy Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just another lineto let you know that I am still quitewell & getting used to Active Service.The Turks are a peculiar crowd &don't relish fighting at all. TheirArtillery is a little troublesome attimes, but we will soon polish themoff. Today was Mail Day & I gotquite a budget of letters & I havejust got through them all in my"dug out", where I have spent thebest of the day. My Subsection hadto relieve "D" Subsection for a week& I just came off today. The gunsare all well dug in & it is nice & comfyin them, but we are not allowedto go near them when we are not firing. The British & French at thelower end of the Peninsular arefinding it a little tougher thanthey expected, as the Turks areso well dug it, & the AlliesArtillery bombarding can be heardall day & all night long. They aresimply going to blow the placeto bits & then chase them withthe bayonet. My word, Mum, Ihope you will be proud of theAustralian Infantry. If you couldonly see the place they havetaken from the Turks, it wouldcause you to marvel. It isthat rough & rugged & steepthat one can scarcely climbit alone & yet they charged &drove the Turks out at thepoint of the bayonet. TheTurkish prisoners said it was terrible to try & stop them.The Sailors off the battleshipswere amazed at them & at oncenamed them the White Gurkas& truly they have earned it.Last week, the VictorianInfantry were withdrawn fromhere & sent down to help theTommies & French take someposition that was causinga bit of trouble & when theVictorians arrived, they letout one wild yell & flew atthem & drove the Turks outflying. They have one fault, &that is the wont wait for anorder & their officers can't holdthem. As soon as they weretold where they had to go, theywent of their own accord& the officers simply had to go with them, or else get lostThe Light Horse are allhere (dismounted) & are doingwork in the trenches & aresimply itching for a bayonetcharge, but we only have tohold this position until theother force drive up the Turksfrom the lower end. Never shallI forget the sight on the Sundaywe landed here. We sailedslowly out of Lemnos at night& anchored outside till daybreak & then followed thewarships around & when wegot in sight of the coast, therewere all over our warships pouringin tremendous broadsides. Thenoise was terrific & the effect ofthe flashes from gun fire wassimply wonderful, & all this was going on whilst we were landingin boats. The noise thatQueen Lizzie was making, wasshaking the whole world itappeared to us. Eight 15 inchguns all going at once. Andthe other fro boats had 12 inchguns going. There were about20 war boats & all were going out atonce, so you can imagine whatthe noise was like.All day, today, the Turks havebeen shelling us, but have doneno damage what ever & havesucceeded in wasting a lot ofammunition. The TurkishInfantry tried a bayonet chargelast night & our boys gave thema lasting remembrance of whatthey got before. The GermanOfficers have to threaten them to make them do it. On the back& I & my subsection have notgot our gun back yet, but itis on board the H.M.S. Princeof Wales being repaired & hopeto have it soon. We had amost unpleasant duty of havingto bury some of our Infantrydead last week & they hadbeen killed on the first dayof landing & were of course"pretty high" but we soon gotthe job through. We had arotten day on my birthdayGunner Beulke was killed bya fall of earth. Lieut Wolfendenwas killed by shrapnel, ArthurMann was wounded in the face& Gnr Collins was hit in the back,& this was the day my gunwas blown up by the Turks, so I'll not forget my 29th birthday ina hurry. I hope you enjoyed yourholiday in Creswick. I am veryglad you went. Tell Mab, thatVerne Ritchie endorsed one of theletters I got & said that he hadwritten to her. I got a letter fromFloss & one from Rupert, 2 fromMab & one from Nell Wheeler. Icannot write to them as I have no time& no materiel , so hope they will acceptmy apologies & thanks.

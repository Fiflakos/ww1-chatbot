Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Mena Camp Cairo EgyptDate: 27 March 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest Mother & all at Home,Another line to let you knowthat I am still in the best of health & am having the bestof good times, altho getting a little tired of Egypt, or Ishould say, Mena Camp & the Desert. The flies & mosquitoesare most troublesome now: They are the most persistent pestsone could possibly conceive; Food on the table looks simplydisgusting through the flies & we simply have to go down to the SergeantsCanteen & get some Ham Sandwiches & a Soft drink & saynasty things about Egypt. We have had all kinds of rumoursas to our departure & we have been packted up all ready tomove off at an hours notice, but always at the last ten orfifteen minutes, down comes an order cancelling previousorders & so we go on day after day expecting a movewhich which never seems to come. It has had a sort ofdepressing effect on the chaps in the Batteries as they aregetting very stale in their work & it cant be wondered ateither, because there is no more monotonous place in thewhole world as the Sahara Desert. We start off in themorning at 9am & the poor horses have to drag the heavyguns & wagons through the loose sand into the Desertabout 4 or 5 miles & to make matters worse, the poor Gunners have to get off the vehicles & walk the whole way & in theface of that the Section Officers (who ride out) rouse the verydeuce out of them for not keeping up with the guns. Bythe time we get out to the manoeuvre ground, the horses arein a lather & have done more than an ordinary dayswork. Once we are out there, we do practically nothing,as officers generally have a Pow wow (lecture & a whisky) &we leave there about 2.30 & get back to camp at 4pm& this cuts us down to 2 meals per day, so you cansee why we are getting tired of the place.To-day, however, we had a variety or a change rather.Private Pickles of the 1st Field Ambulance died at Mena Houseof Pneumonia after 5 days sickness through sleeping outwhilst drunk & the usual thing developed, so yesterdaywe were detailed to supply a gun carriage & team & asmyself & subsection were told off of for the duty, I will giveyou a short description of the Parade. First we had tofix the coffin board on to the top of my gun & shield (thiswas made by the Engineers when we first got here & is inuse nearly every day, so this will tell you how many deathsare taking place) we all got polished up & hooked in& proceeded to Giza tram terminus & the special tram arrivedat 11.am (50 minutes late) with the coffin, band & firing party& the rest of the Ambulance people. The first car heldthe coffin (covered with flowers & Union Jack, Hat & belt)& the second trailer contained the Firing Party & Band &the third trailer held the rest of his company. Beforethis arrived, I might state that whilst we were waitingat Giza, all the niggers for miles around congregatedabout the gun carriage in idle curiosity, telling eachother in their own lingo all about the gun & what ajabbering there was too & the smell of them was not ofRoses, nor yet Violets & I cant say that I could identifymigniontte about it, however whilst their jabbering wasat its highest, two native policemen arrived on the scenearmed with canes, & they proceeded to lay about themright & left & some of the niggers stopped it over theears & neck & other exposed portions of their anatomy& the squealing was to be heard for a hundred yardsoff. One nigger who was selling beer & other drinks hadhis tray snatched from him & dashed to the grounds, sothat glass was scattered in all directions. He triedto remonstrate with the policeman but before he haduttered two syllables he was thrashed unmercifully& then tripped up & sent sprawling into a dirty ditch.Whilst all this confusion was at its highest, the tramarrived & everything then went nice & quiet. The firingparty & band formed up in front of us & the rest ofhis company. He came from New South Wales & theband was one of Sydneys best & we started off to thestrains of Chopins Funeral March. It is very difficultto get our horses to walk so slowly, but my capabledrivers were quite equal to the occasion & the traceswere nice & tight all the way. Handels Dead Marchame next & then we quickened till about a milefrom the Cemetery & then Chopins again. Unlike amilitary funeral in Melbourne, the band goes to thegraveside as well & they played Lead Kindly Light& "Nearer my God to Thee very impressively. Thecemetry was for English speaking people & a portionof it is reserved for the Military Forces. Whilst theservice was on, a plague of locusts was in thecemetry & there was not millions or billions, buttrillions of them & we could not see the walls ofthe cemetry & when we were returning to Camp,they were everywhere. It was a unique spectacle.Most of the hospitals here are run by the LondonTerritorials now & have taken over from the Australiansso this looks like as if we wont be here for long.I am making a lot of bad mistakes in spelling& ommissions in this letter but as I am writing inthe mess room, there is every noise conceivable & arguments (political & otherwise) prevail & I haveto knock off to bog in myself & the consequence is,I hardly know what I am writing at times.Charlie Sheldrake (who Mab knows) is a great Labourman & can get up an argument in any time.Jack Hall is out of Hospital again, I am gladto say, after his attack of Influenza.All the other boys are well, but Dowsett is beginningto go mad again & is not happy unless he has some bodyup before the Major.We are clipping our horses now & I am quite anexperienced hand at the game.I am sending along a couple of Post Cards of TommyGoodall & Mrs Moon which will swell the collection.I will send along some more of the gun being floatedover the canal & some others next week. I hope you got the reserved (another argument) registered parcel alsothe Souvenir of Egypt which I sent to you a fortnightago. Well Mother dear, Ive had my little say thisweek so will close with the best of love to you allat home & kindest regards to all enquirers.I remainYour loving SonNorman.Excuse the writing as thenoise is maddening

I thoughtI was to go on a boatwhich leaves tomorrowbut luck is not withme & I am to waitfor the next lotprobably another month.I'm very disappointed but it's no use grumbling.I'm having a quiet Xmas- Cairo isn't a very goodplace to spend it, asthere are really no decentamusements at all.When I come home I'manxious to get intoone of the hospitalsagain for a whileto rub up my workagain & it's mostimportant to get backearly or all the placeswill be taken by othersreturning. I hope you arekeeping well my dear& not too disappointedbecause I am notwith you this Xmasas you had hoped.However only a shortperiod to wait nowmy dear & all shouldbe well. Lots of love & all sorts ofgood wishes for theNew Year fromYour loving sonWilf

Author: Sheikh Khalid Sheldrake Date: 19 December 1914 Location: The Mosque Waking Surrey Rank: Secretary, British Muslim Society Nationality: Indian Text: The Mosque, Waking Surrey, 19th December 1914 Your Majesty, May I venture most humbly to bring to your notice the existence of a grave danger at the present crisis. The Press have issued cartoons and articles in which the Muslim creed, and the Sultan (its Caliph) have been held up to ridicule. The educated can smile at the humour, but although as far as the Sultan goes he is now the enemy of your Majesty and consequently of ours as your loyal subjects, yet we feel hurt and astonished by the misuse of the word Mahomedan. The Indian soldiers have had copies of these periodicals sent to them; these journals have been circulated throughout the East, and a very unfavourable impression has been produced. We beg your Majesty to use your influence to put a stop to this danger and when Muslims are giving all in your service, we feel sure that it is not your Majestys wish to see our Holy Faith held up to ridicule and our feelings consequently hurt. I wish to bring to your notice that there are hundreds of English Muslims serving in Your Majestys forces and you will understand our feelings on this matter. May Allah preserve your Majesty in best health and may the anxieties and worries of the present grave troubles be a little softened by the thought that Muslims of the Empire are praying for your Majestys life and prosperity. Your service in providing the Indian Muslims cemetery at Woking will always be gratefully remembered by millions of Muslims throughout the Empire May Allah guard and protect you: may Allah give Your Majestys Forces a complete and signal victory is the fervent prayer of Your be..

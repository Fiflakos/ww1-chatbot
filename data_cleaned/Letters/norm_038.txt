To-nighta German Taube & a British Bi-plane were upover our positions at the same time, and everybodywas eagerly looking forward to a scrap, but onewas frightened, & the other wasn't game, so there was"nothing doing" much to the boys disappointment.I wrote you a long letter of 16 pages (a few pages)lately & I hope you received them alright. I havereconsidered what I said to you about promotion, &I think I'll stay where I am. I'll tell you about itwhen I hear more about it.Well, Mother dear, I hope you are all well,What do you think of my proposal re- the house?Think it over & don't hurry about it.How is every-body at home. Give them allmy love & tell them that the Australians are stillholding their positions, altho' we can easily dowith any amount of reinforcements. Send theStay-at-Homes out here, it won't do them any harm.Well, no more news at present, Mother, soI close with the best of love to all and anextra ration for yourself from yourloving SonNorman. P.S. I have just received Mabs letter& "Table Talk" dated 16/6/15, & am gladto know its cold there, because its damnedhot here & the flies are terrible

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 17 October 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Several officers of ours have been so bad (enteric) thatthey are being returned to Aussie - Stopp & Jack Gordonhave gone - Hemming also likely - whilst Weir is alsoreported to be very bad. & may go too.S.I. is now reported down with pleurisy - but anyhow -he was having a huge holiday in Egypt. & if he'dcome up here like a man he'd have missed that.I'm about due for a temp. Captaincy - but I'mafraid my seniors - (over whom I've been moved) willobject to that. I won't go gray with disappointment- but anyhow- 3 stars look better than 2 - so Iwon't say 'no' if I'm asked to take it on.Major Shaw is now temp. Lieut Col. and I amglad, for he & Giles are the only two who have"stuck it" from the very jump.I notice a lot of 'cold footers' have been calledup to train recruits. It's time they were booted in,as they're recd promotion in our absence, - but we'llgive them their deserts soon. It's despicable thatmen holding the King's commission should act so.News just through that Mackensen is leadingthe Hun armies at Belgrade. Gen. Walker was ina M. gun position in my line yesterday - & copped itin the arm. Slight wound -. fainted - (fairly old) - butI don't suppose I'll get a V.C. for helping him.I'm tip-top. Love tc.Rollo

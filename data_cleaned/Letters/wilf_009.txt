My dear mother,Since my arrival here I havereceived no letters though I know you wouldhave written & I am wondering if my letters havereached you & sincerely hope they have as youwould undoubtedly be anxious otherwise & wouldmiss explanations as to my whereabouts explainedin one & not in another. The mails appear to gosomewhat erratically from here also - I do not thinkthat a regular weekly service still exists. By theway I wish you would send me Auntie Lily'saddress in case I should like to write to her orif by any chance I should go there, thoughthe latter is highly improbable. Since I am wroteyou I have gone out a little less as it is ratherexpensive if one is not careful. I had a gameof tennis on some courts near here last week,the courts are made of sand watered &rolled hard & the company who runs themcharges 2/- an hour for the four playerswith balls & racquets includedwhich is really fairly cheap though the racquets are not of the best. However we managedto have quite a good game & enjoyed it. Yesterdayafternoon Wesley & I met at Helipolis at the hospital& had a talk to some of the others then hadafternoon tea & went into the city from whencewe drove in a garry to No TT Hospital atGhezirah just over the Nile on the other sideof Cairo. There are 3 bridges over the Nile& this is near the middle one. It was onceI believe the Sultan's Palace & is a beautifulbuilding situated not far from those gardensI described to you & on the very banksof the Nile. We went there to see Sandy Wilsonwho was chief instrument man at Prince AlfredHospital just like Wright was at Sydney& he went away with one of the Field ambulances.He developed some inflammation in one ofthe nasal sinuses & had an operation butis quite well now. He was out when we wentthere first but we met a couple of Nurseswhom I had known at Sydney Hospital& they told us that Chapman who wasin my year & is also in a Field Ambulanceover here was in hospital. He had had histonsils removed & was convalescent sowe talked to him for awhile & then wentalong & saw Jack James also a medico who was a couple of years aheadof us & son of the minister of St. Enochsat Newtown. He was not so bad at alljust a little off color so we stayed & talkedto him for quite a long time & then we betookourselves to the Presbyterian church in Cairo at 6 p.m.There is a permanent minister there but the congregationconsisted mainly of military people. One fellowwas there with his mother, a medico, who I believeis an only son & his father is dead so his motherhad to come over too. She must have rather aslow time I should think unless she hasmade some acquaintances. We had a decentsermon, slow music rather & the usualnational anthem. Then we wanted dinnerso went into a good restaurant calledthe "Petrograd" & had a good dinnerwhich cost us between 4/- & 5/- each.All the dining places here are situatedin the open without any overhead coveringas it never rains & they almost all haveorchestras. Dinner extends over quite along period & after it is finished one sits& smokes & sips coffee & listens to the orchestraso it quite constitutes an evenings amusementespecially as it does not usually commenceuntil 8 o'clock. Just as we were leaving we met a couple of N.S. Wales doctors, Frizell& Moseley & we stayed & talked with them fora long time, then went for a stroll & camehome. I h am having quite a decent time nowas regards work for I have very little todo at present since all the troops went away,but at last have succeeded in getting thecamp moderately clean - I'm pleased to saythat it looks vastly better than when I camehere. I am making strenuous endeavoursto go back to No I Hospital, but have not yetsucceeded, would be very glad to havesome really good medical or surgical workto do again. Am tired of writing todaymy dear & have little more news to tell sowill close with best love to yourself& all the family fromYour loving son,Wilf.

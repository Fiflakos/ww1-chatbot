Author: James Joseph Makin Location: France Date: 27 May 1916Nationality: Australian Text: P.S. There has not been a mail out for several weeks, hence the delay! France, 27/5/16. Dearest Mother & Father, Your letter of 29/3/16 to hand. Little did you think when you were writing that letter that I was just making myself at home in "Sunny France". I quite imagine you thinking of me browning under the fierce Egyptian sun. It has been very hot in Cairo lately, so I see by London papers. Well, dear parents, two long months have passed away, and I am still "no forrader" as regards taking part in any of the "box on", which still continues, however, with renewed intensity. At present the gallant French "poilus" are still beating off the relentless attacks of the Huns, who continue to press on as if the capture of Verdun was to them all in all. Of course, we know what a prize it is; but is it such that the Germans can h afford to have regiment after regiment of their picked soldiers shattered, and all in vain? The point is this :- The Germans realize what a mighty offensive will shortly be launched against their hard-pressed lines, and they are making a frenzied, desperate effort to achieve a smashing victory, so as to divert some of its strength. But, even should Verdun fall, - which is no more likely than it was two months ago, - it would be a barren victory, inasmuch as the slaughter of their best regiments has been colossal, and such that the Hun "morale" must be permanently shattered. Let us not forget therefore what a debt we owe to these devoted Frenchmen, who are being subjected to such frightful hardship and are bearing the brunt of all the Hun "frightfulness", before the fortress of Verdun! Their steadfast courage and tenacity should never be forgotten, and to us here their success or defeat means everything. I shall not say anything of the Australians for you probably know more about them than I do. I daresay you get a letter from Les every mail telling you of his move- ments.He is now at Weymouth, and again "fit for service". There is a possibility of him getting a position as instructor here in France, for training camps are numerous, and there will be plenty of material to instruct. He must now be an efficient instructor. I hope I shall meet him sometime, but the chances at present are not promising; but of course, one never knows, does one? I was thinking of Muriel and the old violin the other day, and what did I do but write to her - You know, plenty of one does &c, just to make her laugh a bit. I hope I succeeded. I am sending some P/C's to Gert. and Perce this mail as well. I must now close with best love and wishes. Your affectionate son, Jim. 1 DR9

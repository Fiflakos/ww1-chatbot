Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: No 1 Boyton Camp Codford Wilts England Regiment: 1st Divisional ArtilleryDate: 24 February 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: My Dearest Mother, & all at Home;As there is amail for Australia closing to-night, I may aswell write a line, altho there is really verylittle to tell you, - still a line is betterthan none at all I suppose.It is now more than3 weeks since I got a letter from Australia, & Iam wondering whether "Fritz" has sunk some ofour boats, - if so, then thats all the more wehave against him. I am just bursting fornews of home, & I really cannot describewhat joy it is to get news of you all, & I mustsay that you all have been extremely kind to mein writing so much to me, & sending so manyparcels.The weather here now is not nearly socold, but we have had some rain, & theplace is a quagmire, but we are well booted& cloaked, & every man has since had awater proof cape issued to him, & I alreadyhave my fine oilskin, so have nothing to fear.We are having rather bad luck with ourhorses, as skin disease is just sweeping thro'the whole stable, mostly mange & ringworm,& we have to isolate & treat them continuously,& the pharmacy won't give the farriers thenecessary ingredients for washing the horses.Myfarrier sergeant came & told me the other day that the N. C. O in the "Tommy" pharmacy,refused to supply him with the stuff, andsaid that "we blarsted Australians wereonly here on suffrance", so I went down tohim at once, & charged him with it, & askedhim what the devil he meant by it, - andI also asked him did he mind the Australiansfighting & dying on suffrance in active service,& I then enquired if he had seen service, andhe said "No, sir", - well I got to himproperly, & I wont tell you what I said tohim, as it is unprintable, but my farriergot all the stuff he wanted, & a bit more.The Australians have a very bad namein England now, & we get accused of somevery terrible things at times, - for instancethere is a "Tommy" Reserve Brigade of Artilleryhere, who are supposed to be training us, & thisBrigade has 3 batteries, & recently two of theQ. M. Sgts got quarreling over something, & onepulled a revolver & shot the other, who subsequentlydied: at the Court Martial whichfollowed, the accused was asked why he wascarrying a revolver, & he replied "to protectmyself against the Australians", - andhe got acquitted. - That is honest truth.I was told to find a patrolling picquetof 1 Sgt, 1 N. C. O, & 8 men to patrol sometwopenny halfpenny village of 6 houses, lastweek, & I enquired of the Tommy R. S. M.what for, & he told me that we Australianshad been there frightening all the womenfolk. - I, & an officer rode to the villagein question & made every enquiries, & every house-hold told us that the Australians nevercome near the place, & that there was no truth inthe R. S. Ms statement whatever, so I went back& told him what we had done, & he said thatthe patrol would keep our chaps away from themas they did not want the inhabitants molested,so I told him off, & called him a -liar, - and a _ to his face, & I chargedhim with keeping 2 wives there (I already knewthis to be true, so knew what I was talking about)& I threatened to expose him to the Colonel, &he crawled right down, & said he'd promise to havethe patrol abolished. Oh! they are a dirtycrowd these people, Mum - they will sit &drink as much beer & spirits as the Australianswill buy them, & then go outside & say allsorts of rotten things of them.Their dirty littlerotten Sgt cook brought his officer down to myoffice the other day, & said "the Australianshad robbed his cookhouse", so I up & flewat him, & asked him to account for certainXmas gifts that were sent into the cookhousefor distribution to our boys, & also to accounthow he has run our messing account into 12debt, whilst that of the Tommies, (in the samemess) was 3 in credit, & I dished him up afew more of these little savouries, (& by thistime his officer had walked out) so I toldhim that if he didn't clear to Halifax outof it, I would throw him out, so he wentout without further ado.Oh! yes Mum, I'm getting an irascibleold Sergeant Major, but I can't stand this sort ofthing. I received a letter from May Tilton yesterdaytelling me that she had gone to Southall Hospital,which meant France, so I expect that she hasgot her desire fulfilled by now.I still keep intouch with Gravesend, & correspond regularlywith them. I sent them 10/- last week,& 1 yesterday, & I will try & send them alittle now & then. I was thinking of increasingmy allottment to you by a 1/- a day, so ifyou get word about it don't be surprised. Iwill certainly tell you if I do. 4/- a dayis too much for me, & theres nothing to go & seeor buy in this place.We had our new pay sig books issued thislast pay, & these books show how much creditor debt we are in after each pay.I postedthe Will which I made on 4th April 1915, whensailing for Gallipoli in the back of it. It ismade out all in your favour, of course, & inthe event of anything happening to you, it allgoes to Mab. This is should I go under of course.It is the only will I have ever made.Do you get my money alright? - Younever mention that you have any trouble ingetting it, so I take it that everything is O. K.I wrote last week as usual, & hopeyou get all my correspondence. I haven'theard from Ruby Davidson for months, so Isuppose she has "turned me down".I hope you are all well. - My loveto you all Your loving sonNorman. 116th HOWITZER BATTERY24 FEB. 1917Ist DIVL.

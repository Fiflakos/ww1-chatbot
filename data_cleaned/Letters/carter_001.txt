Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Location: Mena Camp Date: 2 December 1914 Nationality: Australian Text: December 2, 1914.Dear Father & Mother,- we are getting off the boat very shortly now;where & when I can't tell you but it is not in England or Europe.Things have gone really extraordinarily well up to thepresent. The difficulties of troopship life must either havebeen very much overdrawn - or we have an exceptional lotof troops - we were told that discipline was verydifficult; that the men were likely to get out of hand &all that sort of thing. Just the reverse has been the casehowever & apparently without very much effort on our part.-- The further we travel - - the more oneis impressed at this crisis with the vastness of the British Empire & the number of resources it has to- I feel certain that the men who return from thisforce will be - the creation of a new element -One feels that it is really a great honour to belong to theforce & so long as this keeps uppermost amongst usthere should not be much trouble- Later. We have just received news (10.15 am) thatletters are to be in by 2 p.m. & that there will be nocensorship - we are lying at the Quay atPort Said; we are going to Alexandria to disembarkthere for Cairo.- Yesterday morning while lying at Suez we saw anew fleet come along - about 12 or 15 transportsescorted by a French battleship -- The chief feature of interest about the Canalwas the defence of it. We saw one Egyptian CamelCorps & one battalion of Royal Engineers but most of thegarrison work was done by Indian (native) troops whowere dotted in small detachments each about 150 strongall along the Arabian side. - In one case afootball match was in progress. It was very fineto see all these things - . Everybody is infood spirits.H. Gordon Carter

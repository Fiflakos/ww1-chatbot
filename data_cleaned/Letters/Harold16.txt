Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 9 January 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: My last letter told you about our raiding parties and I'll [[?enlarge]] upon that & give more details. During this period our raiders have crept out (blackened & dressed as described - sneaked across No Man's Land till they are close to the wire which our fire is [[?s----]] up. After a few minutes of Dante's Inferno [[their]] curtains fire [[as]] befited & extended [[?---hy]] to C E F D. This prevents any reinforcements coming from the flanks - or from X. Directly our fire lifts our boys look in - scupper the Huns & scuttle off with any prisoners, badges etc to our own trenches. Is is the back track that brings our casualties as the Enemy [[watches]] out from the flanks at C.D - with a cross fire from machine guns - Fritz barrage - things are less safe than they might be - so you may guess no one lingers on the back trip. These raids are [[ ---t]]; they keep up our morale, & scare blue snakes out of Fritz, keep us active, [[ t]] our boys [[---]] I [[ ? ]] Hippo for a lighter and better beast from base a fine big black mare a real beauty, in tip top condition. [[ perhaps?]] [[ ? ]] are getting leave to have a redo [[ round?]] in a day or two as my [[?]] (White) [[ ? ]] she's getting bit frisky in weeks since Egypt. The Russians seem to be [[ ? ]] strong, the French are doing pretty well in the Somme - but so far the [[ ? ]] have not done what was expected. Big Push later in the [[Canadians?]], [[ ?]] Africa, & Anzacs will have their turn & I guess something will shift then. [[ Irene? ]] will have read about it in the papers long before this reaches you. I will close now - dear[[?]], love [[ ? ]] wishes from Rollo. Somewhere in France 14 - 7 - 16 Since I wrote we have travelled very many miles, [[ ?]] now a good distance from the firing line. Our boys are not yet in the Somme battle area - but we are being held up in readiness to take our part soon. At present we are being stiffened up - [[plenty?]] of [[scratches?]] 50 has fested over 40 miles last 3 days. [[Cuts aired?]] and detained twice, and we are regular veterans as regards being in the train/g " All our fear is cut down to the [[?]], our transport follows us everywhere in rear of [[ ? ]] Co, in the "Cocker" with steam up, fires burning. Everything ready for our grub. A fine idea. 33 Somewhere in France 17 -7 - 16 cont. This morning (4.31) we marched 8 miles without [[brekker?]] to this village . (don't know the name yet) where is about 12 miles from [[Doulleus?]] on Germany side. The inhabitants are the [[nicest?]] rural folk [[...... seas?]] We were the first "Aussies" they had met - so that we had a rough [[ ? ]] at first, I am [[?]] [[?]], last wire across lanes, and one or two places we had to literally force open. However they are quite [[ ? ]] us & civilised now, & will do anything for us The lady with [[ ? ]] Todd [[ ? Co?]] & I were [[billitted?]] was a very crusty sort at first but now she has changed right round, after grudgingly giving us a room she can't do enough for us now - has found room for our [[domestiques?]] - [[(laterea)?]] & my "Chevaux". The mare has a [[tifa - tefa?]] stable [[?as for]] wheaten hay - [[ ? ]] the old dame just now gave the mare about a complete haystack. [[ ? ]] another place we were in ([[Etaries?]] Todd [[? had]] great luck. We arrived after a night march at 3.30am just as it was getting light. The lady got up - made us some coffee. My word it was good. We were there only 12 hours but she looked after us well. Her only son 'went out' last year - so you can guess her feelings against the [['Alleumaudes']] were intense. That same afternoon Major Herbert & I were [[defected?]] by the C.O to represent the 50 at a East of [[Douttous?]] 14 - 7 - 16 (cont'd) Mayoral Garden Party or At Home - and it was dead funny. The hosts could not "compre" us. nor could we 'compre' them - but we had a good time. so you can guess it was a funny old life we had. This village doesn't hold one inhabitant who can "parlay vous Auglais", & as we "non compre Francois" we get along very well with the townspeople. Now we're out of Flanders, we've last truck with the Fleurs - whom I believe to be pre-German in sentiment and [[acture?]]. Our march this morning was quite Arcadian - Woods, hills, gullies, real poetical brooks, meadows - poppies, green grass, crops of ripening wheat, daisies, red clover to growing wild in the fields - made our route very beautiful. [[ ? ]] [[ ? ]] here like we had in Flanders - [[ ? ]] are there the [[ many? ]] ditches ( a la [[...llicent?]] drains a la Flanders) for the land is drained naturally. This part of France (not Flanders) - is a very beautiful country and Sir Thomas More had no need to go to America for his basis of Utopia. for this country would have amply sufficed. Goldsmith's Traveller describes it well - in fact it is real poetry just to travel through it. I used to think the "babbling brook" , "sweet smelling [[furnesia?]]", "meadows [[ full ]] with daisies" all poetic [["toss"?]] but my word we saw it in reality here = [[... ... ....?]].

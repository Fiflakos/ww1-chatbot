Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Rouge Croix in France Date: 16 June 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: It was a pity one got so plpically tived on sucha trip for really this was a beautiful excursionfor a full minded man. We get some finecherries and hope to get more later, - the firstI'd had for years it seemed. We would halt 3 timesa day - (one hour each stop) while the men werefed & provided with hot water for their tea, sowe did fairly well.We detrained at a place was Hazelbrook at midnt.and then marched 4 miles to this village, wherewe are billeted. We are about of dist betweenHazel. & Ypres, Armentieres is about miles offand all day long we can hear them at it - soprolably before long we will be in it too.Our old 10th Battn is in the trenches just westof A. so we have been able to get a little newsfrom them. They have had a pretty rough timebut as they have given Fritz a harder time -things are not so bad with them.We are close to the Belg. border, and mostof the people in this arllage are Flemish. Theyhave some interesting tales to tell of the eightday in Oct. 1914 when the Huns over ran thispart. Living results exist of their visit, & nowwe realise what 'war' means in one's country& the boys will fight like hell when their turn comes

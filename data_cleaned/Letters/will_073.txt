Author: W E Peyton Date: 20 March 1917 Location: France Nationality: British Text: 20.3.17GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.My dear GeneralI think matters areturning too much justat present for me tomake any long talked ofvisit. I dont supposeyou will be able to remainwhere you are very long.I have had the scheduleslooked up nothing ever camein for Durnford, the other Chaplain who was on the sameSheet in your copy came into us on a sheet by himself.All good luck to you. Thesituation is very interesting & Iam afraid for the troops attendantwith a good many difficultiesI wonder what the Boche reallymeans any way it is a greatthing to get him in the month & if he intends an offensive intothe Divisions he has I believehim foredoomed to failure.I saw a telegram after it hadbeen sent (draft by G.S) to Australian Governmentannouncing that Baupaumehad fallen to the Australians& winding up with the hopethat sufficient -re-inforcementswould be forthcoming fromAustralia to enable their Corps'to continue their brilliantsuccesses. Is there any difficultyabout reinforcements & was the tone of the cable a wise one?I rather thought not. I hopeCarruthers is standing the strainallright. I was up withGodley last Sunday.Yours alwaysWE Peyton

Author: R Wingate Date: 2 May 1917 Location: Cairo Egypt Nationality: British Text: CAIRODictated2nd May 1917My dear BirdwoodI hope, before you receive this letter,news will have reached you that all has been satisfactorilyarranged with regard to your Nile Decoration and Iwarmly congratulate you on being given the Grand Cordon.I was delighted to get your interestingletter of the 11th February. Since it was written I expectyou have been at it hammer and tongs and we are all amazedand delighted at the splendid successes which have beenachieved by the British Troops in France. I have not theslightest doubt that the 1st ANZAC Corps has taken a verybrilliant part in this terrific fighting and I hope yourcasualties have not been very heavy. The French offensivein the south must also be very disconcerting to the boschesand I earnestly trust that the combined efforts of theAllies will so shake the Hindenberg line as to make ituntenable.Please give my best regards to Smyth andany other old friends in the Corps. Whenever I mention your name to the Sultanhe beams with pleasure and evidently considers you one ofhis best friends - he is also a man for whom I have agreat respect and affection and it is a grief to me to seethat his health is now so indifferent - A complete changeabroad and a water "Cure" might help matters, but I amafraid nothing of this sort is possible until the war isover.I much appreciate all you so kindly didin regard to Forth - Almost immediately on his arrival herehe was rushed out to the Gaza front in command of anAustralian Battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps and Iregret to say that in the second fight he was wounded inthe shoulder, but I have not found out yet where he us orwhether the wound is very severe.I am afraid my friends in France mustthink I have become an extremely bad correspondent but thework here is very heavy and takes up all my time so thatprivate correspondence has to go by the board, but I hopewhen we go down to Alexandria next month to be less rushed. I have no time to write more but will only wish you andyour gallant Corps the very best of luck and an earnestwish that you will soon completely smash the bosches.Yours very sincerely ,R WingateGeneral Sir William Birdwood, K.C.S.I.,K.C.M.G., C.B., &c.1st ANZAC Corps,British Expeditionary Force,France.

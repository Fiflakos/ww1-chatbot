My dear Birdwood.Many thanks for your letter of the 7th June and most interestingreport on operations by the Anzac Corps which you send meto see. I have read them with the greatest pleasure. It is arecord of hard hammering fighting such as the Australians havehad so much of right through. It is wonderful how they come upagain, time after time, fresh and ready to begin it all once more.This I am sure is mainly due to your influence and leadership -they would not have been able to do it without that.I hope you will have a good time when you do come home andas good weather as you are having now,and that I may see you asyou pass through town one may or the other.We are very pleased at my boy having got the Military Crossfor organizing and commanding a successful raid in his battalion.He has now gone to Italy as a Staff Captain and will be there forsome months I gather.All well here.Yours ever, HV. Cox.

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Sarpi Camp Lemnos Date: 19 December 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear F. & M., - Well I suppose you have received the news by this time, that we have evacuated Suvla & Anzac. Tonight while I am writing the 1st & 5th brigades are leaving Anzac - & they are either getting off with no action - or else being practically annihilated. I can't tell you my feelings regarding this - but I have seen at least two hardened soldiers - (Boer war men too) weeping over the news. We all fell extreme disgust at the weakness of K's army, - who bungled up the 'Sari Bahr' action, & fuddled Suvla Bay. I wonder what has become of our wonderful diplomats - the have certainly absolutely bungled the Balkan business The whole problem was the inefficient, incapable, & badly led troops sent from England to 'help' us against Sari Bahr - & to do the Suvla Bay occupation. If they had been shoved in right, we would have finished Jacko by the end of August - the Bulgars, Grks, Romanians &c would have been confident of British success, & we wd. have gone into Germany through Austria, & by now the war would be over. Owing to the colossal failure Greece & Romania hang off - while Bulgaria has gone over to what appears the winning side - so that the Balkan question is now going to loom large in the destiny of Egypt, India & the British Empire. I knew so much as I do about the Salonika business - you would feel absolutely disgusted. Due to our actions Serbia has been pushed into the mire just as Belgium was. Like the policeman - we were too late - and things had so developed that heavy artillery got so near, & caused the evacuation of Anzac & Suvla. It was futile holding on to those places then - for we were confined by almost impregnable positions; the Huns had effected a complete junction with Bulgaria & Turkey and Gallipoli wasn't on the route to Egypt, and as well the wear & tear of war, the wastage of disease & actions, a winter campaign under conditions totally unprovided for did not warrant holding such an unnecessary position - so we have ben withdrawn for some other purpose. When we calmly think over it I believe the "leaving" was the best & proper plan - so we must put sentiment on one side - altho' it is hard for us to leave so many of our best & dearest who went out there, - after innumerable fatigues, worries, many risks - & with no tangible result as the effect of their sacrifice. We are not the only ones who blames Ks Men; the French won't have them, hence they are not sent to Salonika. We are unfortunate - as it was our turn for a stunt - but we were relieved by the 1st Bgde - hence they have the luck to get the final scrap. if there is a 'go' - it will be a beauty - the Turks will get hell right enough - but very few of ours will get away. One is uncertain what tense to use over this matter for the business is very probably on at this very moment. Anyhow I would like to be in that scrap- it will be a fight - not a trench affair. On the other hand we may get off quietly fwithout any serious casualties - I sincerely hope so - but in any case before Jacks gets nito our position many of him will be blown to eternity. The Batt commanded by Brand came back today- Hardy is with them. Alfic P. was their adjutant, & Hen. Panl had a brother who went out with them. The Bn. looks ot Once our Division re-organises we will be the best in the BritishEx (this is fact not blow) mind I don't say Dr. Aony- for that means K. Cs- who are mund. I don't feel up to writing more tonght - so I will hold off till tomorrow. Decr 20 It may surprise you as it did us to a certain extent - but they got off last night without a scrap I had less casualties than reawr on an ordinary night. Only 6 casualties seems umbeliionble but it is true my word it relieved us to know Providence had been merciful your boys got away so well. Cheer - we did just yell - when the first of the "evacuators marched past us, my word Dod, we are glad that Austraian feneralship succeeded so well.- but if there had been a scrap thered have been a much different tale to till I dreamed & is twoce last negter- Tit was a weanty MNH The final party was well clear by dawre - fone or two T.P.D. fa moniior, were all that was left of a huge fleet About 7 a.m. this morning Jacko gave hone Pine & silt Spur a terrible bombardment and an attack was make in Russelk's Sop - (Walker's Ridge) in broad daylight. - but our boys were far away. The Ravy spotted the attack and stopped it with a few shells but in any care, the wonder is the easy way in which our chaps fot away Our boys are working several atunts here peaceful of course each platoon has a large marquee allotted, to it &here is great rivaloy to see whose is the cleanest in the lines. The latest crage is Art, Decoration, & Enguiality. Every tent is surrounded by borders of stones very neatly arranged some have made lime for whitewask, swhitened the stones. One artist worked in front of his tenty the Australion coat of Arms - in rebbles, & them whitewashed them. Another improved on this by making the same with broken bits of colored flacs, &then the craze spread. Australias with plass, wattle leaves, orarge peet for bloasoms - S.A. crow shorkes or magfres - to rave everywhere but my boys are the most onginal. They have mad a lnge design on a heaped syr reorned 8th by 4 representing in plass typical aceres at Bo. Hill. It poppet head toverground works of Block are shown, the job has been very well done. The G.O.C. Division was exstartic over it when he saw it, tthe B.H. boys puor over it like a mother cat over kils The design is well shrown out by whiteward & colored glass and I believe the beggard must have raided one of the huge churches to get such a variety & quantity We still do morning parade - but Sports in afternoon my lot got 6 goats 8 behinds against. No 10 - 28ls 8 tthe result was much joy in Nr. 9. I played with them, and am still very stiff as a result.

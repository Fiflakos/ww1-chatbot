Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: County of London War HospitalEpsom Surrey EnglandDate: 27 December1915 Nationality: Australian Text: (Dear Mabs birthday)Dearest Mother & all at Home.Just a line to let youknow that I am quite well & enjoyed Xmas immensly.I have simply been overwhelmed with good things& presents, & it has been the surprise of my life, &being a stranger in a strange land, I expectedto have a very quiet time, but friends have comesuddenly on me from everywhere & loaded mewith all kinds of things, and invitations toXmas dinner in galore, which I was compelledto decline. One of my bombardiers (Arthur Maure)who is in England told his friends of my whereabouts& I got a lovely invitation from them (I am sendingyou the letter) & they offered to fetch me in their Car.When I wrote and thanked them profusely, & toldthem that I was still confined to bed, they at oncecame & visited me. One young lady in great fursEtc, & an Elderly lady who introduced herself as aMiss someone or other, & they made such a fussof me that I though I should spring out ofbed. And I didnt know what to say of course,& felt an awful fool, & being in a very shymood, I could not look them in the face, & here were they piling parcels of sweets & fruits & booksand magazines on my bed, & at the sametime telling me how sorry they were to think Icouldnt come to their place, & that Papa wouldbe awfully disappointed & I dont know whatMother will say & all that kind of thing. Wellwhat could I do or say. You can just pictureme there in bed like a big galoot just born.They stayed all the afternoon & made mepromise that I would come & stay with them onfurlough & they would come & bring me in theirCar, & Papa would take me to his country farm& goodness only knows what they didnt sayto me. After they went & I had recovered fromthe shock, I began to open the parcels & I wasas nervous as a thief. Here was a tremendousbox of chocolates (great big ones too), a box of choiceoranges, a whole tin of beautiful short bread, abox of caramels, & toffee & 2 great boxes of Bonbons, & Magazines & Papers too numerous tomention. The bon bons simply knocked merotten. I cant imagine why they gave me these.I thought they were only for kids parties, &I asked the Nurse, & she said of Oh Xmasis not complete without them. I put myhead under the clothes & simply roared. Awfully decent of them, wasnt it.? Thena brother of one of our Sergeants who lives inEngland & works at the War Office, came &brought me a host of sweets & fruits & Cigarettes& an invitation to their place when I go onfurlough. Then Lady Almonde came & gaveus each a parcel containing a cake of chocolate,a pipe, tobacco, cigarettes & such like, & spokevery nicely to us; Then the Red Cross peoplecame & more tobacco, fruits, sweets pouredonto Normans bed. Then the Postman came& brought letters, Christmas Cards Etc, from allkinds of people, Sir George Reid, Lady Birdwood,Australian Defence people, Red Cross people,Australian visitors in England, & from Julia,& Harriet as well, & from some of my chapsin other hospitals.Our ward was decorated with holly &green stuff, & mistletoe was hung over allthe doors, & there was a great deal of kissingof nurses, sisters, matrons, & visitors, & games& music & dancing was indulged in tillall hours next morning. The Dr let meup for Xmas day, but I was sitting bythe fire nearly all the time & took very littlepart in the festivity, but we all enjoyed ourselves immensely. Dinner was of ChickenRoast Pork (no stuffing tho) baked spuds & cabbage& Plum Pudding & Custard to follow. Not toobad eh? All the same I was thinking ofhome & everybody, & wished that next XmasI might be home with you all. Ill supplythe dinner, now dont forget that please.A few more patients arrived from theDardanelles last night & they were all Tommies.No more Australians are coming to England tillafter the winter. Snow fell the other day & itlooked very nice. I still write regularly toGravesend & they always answer affectionately.How did you all spend Xmas? I hopeyou all enjoyed yourselves. I have had nomail from Australia since September. I havenot been able to write to any of my manyfriends in Victoria & would feel glad if youwould kindly let them know of me. I hope yougot my Cable. The Dr says that we must nottry to get well too soon, as we are here from for a longtime & will get 6 weeks furlough. Well Mother dear,I hope you are all well; Give my love to themall & tell Mab that Ive been thinking of her today.Best love to Mab, Chas, George, Rupert & Floss &to all relations & an extra big whack for yourselffrom your loving son, Norman.

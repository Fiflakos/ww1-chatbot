Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Mena Near Cairo EgyptDate: 9 December 1914 Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest MotherJust a line to let you know that we arehere in the Sahara Desert right alongside the Pyramids &are getting into shape for the Glorious time to come.We arrived at Alexandria and disembarked & thenwe entrained for Cairo. Our horses & men are very fitand the journey through, alongside the Nile was simplybeautiful. I only wish I could describe it to you. Allthe way down one could see the country on either sidewhich was irrigated & very prosperous & the natives &their mud hut villages were very picturesque. TheArabs themselves are very filthy living people as well asdisgusting beasts. They know no bounds to loading uptheir poor little donkeys & then climb up themselves &ride. Our fellows are always wanting to knock them downbut Kitchener made a law forbidding white men hittingArabs or other natives. Now about Cairo, Well Motherit is a wonderful City & the houses are simply mansions& exceed anything we have in Toorak or Melbourne, Ofcourse the Arab quarters are different & are as vile &stinking places as one could imagine. Poverty is asconspicious as enormous wealth. At 2 am the othermorning when we were marching out here, the poorerclasses could be seen lying asleep on bridges & in gateways & even on the pavements. We arrived at Cairo at6 o'clock & detrained & went to the Barracks to water& feed our horses & at midnight we had to marchout to our camping place (a distance of 10 Miles & leadingour horses too) & at 3.15 am, we arrived in camp &proceeded to pitch camp & put down horse lines. Well, it was very cold but our walk made us nice& warm & as soon as we picketed our horses, we alljust lie down & got what sleep as we could get in 2hours & it was tremendously cold when we awoke.However, the sun gets up early in the Desert & soongets to work & at 9 oclock, it is about 90 in the shade sothis will tell you what kind of weather it is like. ThePyramids are right alongside our camp & are wonderfulthings, They are made of enormous blocks of stone & eachone fitted in to each other & are about 400 feet high.The Electric Trams run right out to the camp & of coursebring plenty of tourists to see the Pyramids. All thedirty work to done by Arabs & other natives at camp &the prinicipal method of conveyance is donkey carts &camels. These poor creatures are called on to do enoughwork to kill bullocks & the camels are loaded upwith baggage of all sorts. We get Leave of Absence ofa night & go into Cairo, & after having a tremendous feed,stroll about the City & see the sights. All the money isdifferent & is in Piastres of which 97 go to 1. Thereare all kind of people in Cairo, French, Turks,Arabs, English, Portugese, Italians, & Greeks, so there isplenty of variety. All troops are not in camp yet, asthe boats have to wait some time to get through theSuez Canal. All the Desert on the north west ofthe Canal was flooded to prevent any Turks comingthat way. We were not allowed to land at Port Saidbut what we could see of it, it was a stinking hole.I was very glad to get off the old boat & itwas a treat to be on land again, I was that pleasedthat I ran like blazes when I got ashore for about200 yards. The native police thrash the Arabswith canes & it is very funny to see them all goingfor their lives with a "John" after them & vendorsselling oranges, Dates etc are knocked flying, andas they stoop to pick them up, the "John" gives themsuch a beauty over their rear as they pass We passed several Harems on our way down fromAlexandria & saw the wealthy Egyptians with theirnumerous wives sitting on the banks of the River &of course we all gave them a great "Ahoy". But myword, Mum, the women were beautiful, their complexionexceeded anything I have ever seen, & dressed to kill.They were not dressed in Harem skirts, but ordinarystylish dresses. Other women were heavily veiled, &have a peculiar shaped stick on their noses. The Frenchwomen in Cairo are remarkably beautiful & theirdresses are wonderful in more senses than one, & howthe devil they manage to get them to stick on I don't knowthe dress doesn't go over their shoulders at allMen of all classes only wear one sort of Hat, alittle red turks cap called a Fez, Arabs wear any-thing that will go on, & the boys & girls up to 10 & 12only a smile. We had a great "night out" the nightbefore last, & finished up at 3.30 am riding donkeysIt is very funny riding these poor little beasts & atthe same time cruel, as an Arab runs behind allthe way & thrashes his behind with a piece ofpacking case. The Roads are all like CommercialRoad here, & have great trees all the way along &meet over head & the Motor Cars go like mad.I hope you got my other letters alright & Ihope to get some soon (I have only got 1 from Victoria& that from Jack Tilton) I send my best love to everybody who enquires after me & to Aunts & Uncles,Cousins & an extra ration to all at home & 2 extrarations for yourself from your loving son,Norman.

Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: Lord William Birdwood Date: 21 July 1916 Nationality: New Zealand Text: Dear Sir William Birdwood,I have to thank you for your letter ofMay 22nd. just received.With regard to your question,whether I had a reply fromthe Secretary of State in respect to the use of cipher "V"I got a reply that it could be used at that time,but of courseI had previously had an order that it was not to be used.I have very little news to give you from here,I have justinspected the 15th Reinforcements which will leave shortly,I hear good accounts of them from the side of discipline, butneither they nor their predecessors the 14th have had quitesuch a high musketry average as former drafts,it must not beforgotten however that the weather at this time of year is notof the best,and perhaps my remarks on this subject are a littleprejudiced,as you are aware we were somewhat strictly broughtup in the Rifle Brigade as to this.I think you will probably find that the officers, whoare being sent you now,are somewhat better trained,as a longer period is required of them namely 6 months for those who havehad previous territorial training, and 11 months for those,who have not.Parliament is still sitting,but I hope that it willfinish shortly,as the time of Ministers is very much hinderedand this especially applies to the Minister of Defence, andthe Department generally,however on the whole all goes well,though like everywhere else there are " disgruntles ".I am glad to hear from Sir John Cowans that the HospitalShips are doing good work.I always feel glad to send you any information to you [[Txxyxx]]I can, as you are half a Lincolnshire man,like myself,at leastthrough your wifeWith every good wish Believe meYours sincerelyLiverpool.

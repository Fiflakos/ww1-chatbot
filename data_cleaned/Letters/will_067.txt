Author: J W Legge Date: 16 February 1917 Location: London Nationality: British Text: London16 February 1917Dear SirWith reference to mytelegram concerning an appealto G.H.Q., the copy of the cableyou sent to Australia is certainlynot quite what I had beenled to believe. At the sametime your views, as expressedin your letter, were entirelyunexpected by me. Any Appealeven if upheld would in thesecircumstances be futile,because I should still haveto return to Australia.General White has nodoubt informed you that I am leaving England bythe Kaisar-i-hind today.I trust your opinion ofthe 2nd Aust. Div. maynow be changedYours obediently,JW Legge

Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Lemnos Island Date: 7 October 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest Mother & all at Home. As you will see by the above address, I amback out of harness, but not in Gallipoli, but rather in Hospital, resting.I was picking up tip-top for awhile, but got off colour somehow& my Sergeant mate in the 2nd Field Ambulance advised me to stay inbed for a couple of days, but instead of getting better, my temperaturehopped up to 103o so he brought his Dr down to me & he at once orderedme into Hospital. I told him I did not want to miss going back to thePeninsular with the remainder of our boys, & he said "it all depended howI felt, but would do his best for me", however just as I was kidding myselfI was doing fine, my temperature went up again, so he examinedme all over, & transferred me to the Australian Stationary Hospital forobservation, & after being there for 5 days, was then transferred to the"joint" I am now in. (A Tommies Hospital with Australian nurses incharge of the wards) No 18 Stationary Hospital. It is not a patchon our Australian Hospitals, both as far as Doctors & Orderlies & Generaltreatment is concerned & the only grub we get is boiled Rice or Arrowroot& we are all heartily sick of it, & have promised ourselves something extraspecial when we are discharged. However, you will be pleased to knowthat I am quite well again & my temperature & pulse are normal &have been this last week & I hope to get out soon so please don't worryNearly all the patients here are Tommies, & what ahelpless lot they are too. They are calling the Sister & Orderly all thetime. The chap next to me is in the Royal Irish Fusiliers & amost extra ordinary person he is too. When he is spoken to, hisfunny old face goes into all shapes & then he just stares & his mouth wide open too. And most alarming noises comes out ofhis face when he is sleeping, you know, something like a noise whichcomes from a fowl with its head just cut off. His face is going thro'all kinds of contortions all day long. He was making some of hisfunny old noises yesterday & the Sister went & roused him & askedhim what the trouble was, & after a lot of hideous contortions Etc,he said "His bhed was [[onaisy?]]" so his bed had to made afresh.The rest of the Tommies are not quite so bad, but Sister told methat she would rather attend to 3 Australians than 1 Tommy.The harbour is still full of shipping & the Navy are havingthe best of time kicking about in white suits & their warboatsare covered with a big canvas awning & nicely painted & allthat sort of thing. The Lord Nelson & Agamemnon are the biggestof the British & the French have a lot big ugly battleships doingnothing. We saw the British Submarine which was up the Sea ofMarmora for 31 days & she looked very slimy & dirty.The mammoth ships Mauretania & Acquitania are bothhere in Port. The latter is an Hospital Ship, but theformer carries Troops & Stores. The Aquitanias decks areA to G above the water line & H to L below. They areenormous vessels. but out of 9 of the 4th Battery who came away forfor a rest, only 3 are going back. 3 are in Hospital; 3 havebeen ordered a further rest, so that leaves only 3 to returnto Gallipoli. My Mail is at Gallipoli, so I haven't got anythingin the way of news from Home, but I told them to keep it theretill I return as it only goes astray when one goes into Hospital.I told you in my last letter about the Colonel offering meColumn Sergeant Major & my refusing it on account of beingcrook didn't I. I am not doing any more about the transfer asour Major talked me over & palmed me down, so I'll still bewith the 4th Battery. Well Mother dear, I hope you are allwell at Home & elsewhere. Give my love to them all & kindregards to all kind enquiries & accept fondest lovefrom your loving son, Norman. Excuse writing as Im in bed. (my mistake) .

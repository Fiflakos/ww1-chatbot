Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 12 February 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Camp Heliopolis Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 12. 2. 1916My dear mother,Another quiet & uneventful weekhas passed by & we are still in our little camp bythe sea. We have had quite a number of visitorsthis week, almost every meal we have had two orthee extra & have had some merry meetings,generally ending with a little game of bridge orsome old game such as Rickety Kate which anumber can play at the same time. During theday we have been indulging in a little Ambulancedrill which has been interesting as I have neverdone very much of it before. Beyond this, my dearthere is practically nothing to tell you as dayfollows day with little change. One day howeverI rode up to see Parry, who was in my year& came came over with me in the same boat & is nowattached to another ambulance. We hadlunch together & a long talk over old times.It was quite a pleasant ride along the beachfor 3 or 4 miles. Then yesterday afternoon, lo! &behold! cousin John Evans & an officer fromhis Ambulance came along to afternoon tea and we had quite a roomfull as there weretwo or three other people here. He looks verywell & likes El Arish. I am enclosing acircular which was sent me from theSydney University Union - if you have anyspare photos of mine I would be gladif you would send one along to them, butplease - no extract from letters. Todaywe had a photo of the Ambulance taken& I am sending my film up to Cairoto be developed & hope to get a decentpicture from it. I am sending alongone or two photos I have taken withmy new camera & hope you like them.One of the pictures you may recognizeor rather the chief figure in it, who ismyself. I really am very stuck for news mydear & don't think I can fill any more pagesthis time so will conclude there, with muchlove & a hug fromYour loving son,Wilf.

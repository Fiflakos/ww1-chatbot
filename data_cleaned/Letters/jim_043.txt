Author: James Joseph Makin Location: Troopship At Sea Date: 29 February 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father, As you see we have not yet reached our destination but we are on our way. We must send our letters in to the censor by tomorrow, so I have left writing until the last day. The weather has been fine and hot since we left W.A. and the sea calm for the most part. Each day now is alike and the boat is becoming monotonous. We shall all be overjoyed when we come to disembark. I was vaccinated a few days week ago and have had no trouble so far. Some of the lads have sore arms and minor sickness through the vaccination, but I felt no ill effects at all. We are having an easy time, very little drill and plenty of time to oneself. Nearly everyone is wearing only a singlet and "shorts". My legs are fairly brown already. The sun is overhead at midday and very hot too. One can always find a cool spot where there is a breeze. I am glad I am not in the A.M.C. as they are kept fairly busy on board while we have all our time to ourselves. I was unlucky enough to lose my fountain pen overboard one night. I had it clipped into my pocket but it was levered out by the rail as I leant on it watching the sea. I shall get another when I reach Egypt as they are very handy. I am still writing up my diary but news is very scarce, each day being practically the same. One longs for a swim on a hot day but one must be content with a sea- water shower. The nights seem very long as we travel with lights out, and the only pastime is to sing all the songs you can think of till it is time to turn in. It is too hot to sleep in hammocks so we take our blankets on deck. We had a concert on Saturday afternoon given by the ship's crew. It was very successful, and afternoon concerts are to be held in future as frequent as possible. The sunsets are very beautiful and we always spend the time between tea and dusk in watching the water and sky. I am always wondering what the latest war news is and how Les is getting on and whether he is still in England. I am looking forward to some letters and papers. Are you getting my pay 1 from the Barracks alright? I hope you I am feeling the benefit of the trip, I think, now that it is nice and calm, but I did not think I would make much of a success as a sailor after striking a rough trip to Adelaide. Most of us miss a bit of fruit; we had some good feeds of it in Perth though. It is surprising how light hearted everyone is. One would think they were going on a big picnic. Anyway no one thinks much about the war. The main topics are "Where do you think we'll go?" or "How long will we be in Egypt?" "How much money will I have when I land"? &c. Many who brought a few pounds with them and only 1/- per day are sorry now that they have lost their "roll" gambling. We saw the "Karoola" at Fremantle, inward bound with 400 returned soldiers on board. I suppose I have passed Jack Scanlon on the water as he left England about the middle of January. Everyone at my table is writing letters this afternoon. I have got to write a few more this afternoon before tea as I go on guard in the morning and will not have another chance. I should be able to find more news for my next letter. There is certainly not much to write about just now. Am sending a few lines to Harry and Essie this time. Remember me to Mrs. Spence; if I had Norman's address I could look him up if I got near him in Egypt, also Gordon Stirling. Will now conclude with love to all. Your affectionate son, Jim

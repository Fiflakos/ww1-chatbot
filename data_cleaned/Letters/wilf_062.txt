Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 26 September 1916 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Camp Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 26.9.1916My dear mother,Two letters from you arrived lastnight with mail up to Aug. 11th. Mail for Australiacloses I believe today so I am just scrawling afew lines to let you know I received them. I sentletters previously by this mail but will just add alittle. Am just riding about 6 miles to dentist asI think one of my teeth needs attention. Everythingvery dull & quiet here - very little to do & everybody isstale. So sorry to hear that Alice is unwell - ifanything requires attention, let her see the bestpeople not the Newcastle one only, but I sincerelyhope she will be better now. Very sad about Leah'shusband wasn't it? Everybody certainly seems to havetrouble nowadays. I agree with you that it doesseem a never-ending business - this being away - butlet us hope that the war will end before very long. Iam wanting to see you just as much as you wantme but prospects at present don't seem very brightunless I could get really sick & I don't thinkthat seems probable at present - as I amfattening up again. I am very worriedabout you though & do hope that the nextmail will bring better intelligence as to the state of your health. Do keep intouch with Dr Rennie if you are notwell & let him know how you progress& please let me know truthfully how youare. I do wish I could come along &help you at present but that is outof the question I fear. Take care ofyourself & your diet & don't do toomuch & try not to worry & all willbe well & we will yet have that littlejaunt to England together as soon asthe war is over.Best of love fromYour loving son,Wilf

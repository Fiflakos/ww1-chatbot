Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Location: Mena Camp Date: 24 February 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Mena Camp.24/2/1915We are all very annoyed at the rumours that have beencirculated in Australia about the behaviour of our troopshere. - Undoubtedly there have been excesses(in some cases serious) - but - I have been informedon many sides by local inhabitants & the localpress confirms that the general behaviour is reallyexcellent; moreover any misdemeanours areproperly handled by the town picquets. - We had one of our reinforcements play up - the otherday - This chap threatened an officer with a bayonet it took the whole guard to arrest him (about 12 men)& then he started shouting & resisting. So he was peggeddown to the ground and gagged. He loosened the firstlot of pegs and nearly got away. They put stronger pegsdown this time. He is now spending a few days ina detention barrack where they get plenty of work & very little food and sleep. So things are not being let goas the article in Sunday Times would seem toinsinuate. - I took the nurses to the Zoo& we saw there the two Turkish Pontoons with whichthe Turks attempted to cross the Canal. They weremade of aluminium & were riddled with holes,mostly from shrapnel.

Author: James Joseph Makin Location: France Date: 1 May 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France, 1/5/16. Dear Father, Just a line to let you know that I am getting on alright so far, and up to the present have had nothing to complain of. I am not sorry, or never have been, that I enlisted when I did. On the contrary I have often thought that I should have come before I did, although it was hard whilst Les was in danger to think of asking mother. Although it is not three months since I left home, it seems much longer. I think I can claim to be a better man than when I was at home, chiefly because such a life as one leads as a soldier on active service cannot help but broaden one's mind and make him look on the better side of life. All petty troubles and quarrels fade before the one great aim, which is to carry the war through and get home as quickly as possible. One lives with men of all stations, creeds, character, ideals, and from them he sees his own weaknesses, and, if he possesses sufficient will power, he corrects them. Arguments will arise, - very hot arguments indeed - and men will express themselves very forcibly - perhaps it will lead to blows, - but immediately the argument drops, things go on as before. There is no such thing as a difference of opinion lasting more than an hour or two at the most. I often think that if ever I get back it will be a new life, so to speak- just like being born again. What do you think of Les remaining in England so long? I can imagine mother and Ruby hoping he will be kept there altogether. I got a letter from him yesterday telling me how he won his promotion at Gallipoli. You must know how I was longing to hear his tale before I went went into action myself. I had to drag it out of him by writing him all questions in my letters. Even now it is only the barest outline, and told so reluctantly and modestly that I feel that this modesty is just as praiseworthy as the actual deeds themselves. Have you ever been able to draw anything from him about his campaign or his sickness? He says he has had a good time lately, but how well has he earned it? I think I could get letters quicker through him than direct from home. At any rate I have asked him to let me have the news after each mail he gets from home. He has made a very good friend in a Dr. Gibson, an English R.A.M.C. man. I dare say he has mentioned him in his letters home. I received a letter from Capt. Gibson, and from the tone of it he has great admiration for Les, and he wants to get to know me because he says Les has often spoken, to him of me. I am awaiting . an opportunity to answer his letter, but we do not get much time for writing. I am still in the same training camp and it is five weeks tonight since we arrived in France. I am feeling a much more efficient soldier, but have still a lot to learn for the "Germhuns" are no mug fighters, by all accounts. They tried to "strafe" us with a few bombs on "Anzac" night but happily made some good misses. The sound of the explosions was terrific in the still night air, but we did not lose much sleep. We saw the craters caused by the bombs next day, and they are evidently very powerful bombs. Les, was telling me that he saw them bring down the L15, the Zeppelin which landed at the Thames mouth. It must have been a good sight. We go for a route march to neighbouring villages now and than. The young crops are about 6 inches high, and hares can be seen stealing away in almost every crop. I always think of you, and think how you would like to be near with your "double -barrel". It would be fine sport with some good greyhounds, There are also a few rabbits about. Do you ever go out shooting now? I will be going out shortly, but after Huns instead of game. How is Perce getting on this year? I should try and keep him at school as long as possible if I were you. I am sure that it is the better plan, and he will thank you for it later on in life. All he wants is a little encouragement now and than and to be shown that you are interested in his work, and he will be a good boy, I am sure. I am looking forward to some letters from you all. I think they will be regular once they start coming. It is pleasing that the Irish rebellion is not as alarming as it was thought and is now dying out. It is most regretable that it should have occurred at this time. It is the fanatical Sinn Feiners at the bottom of the trouble, & the Nationalist Party under Redmond is absolutely against them. It is astounding when you see the Irish regiments here in France, fighting along with the rest of us-Australians, N-Z-ers, & Canadians. The news of Townshend's surrender was a big shock and it certainly does not improve the situation in Mesopotamia. Like the Dardanelles adventure the Turks have again been held too cheaply. I must now finish off as I have more letters to write and my time is very limited, so will now say goodbye till you hear next mail. Your affectionate son, Jim

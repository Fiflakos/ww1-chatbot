Author: James Joseph Makin Location: Zeitoun Cairo Egypt Date: 11 March 1916Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father, This is my third day in Egypt and second in Cairo. I chanced to be in the city this afternoon and on entering the Y.M.C.A. Gardens I was struck by the notice "Mail closes for Australia at 4 30 p.m.," so I thought I would write you a few words. I have only half an hour in which to do it. I spent yesterday afternoon walking round the city sight seeing. It is a strange place at first to an Australian, narrow streets, and tall white buildings and thousands of native urchins and vendors worrying you at every turn to clean your boots, sell you a cane, post cards or souvenirs of Egypt. I find it is good policy to have your boots clean and to carry a cane; it saves you endless bother saying ishmi "imshi" ("clear out") I went along all the main streets and saw the chief buildings in the heart of the city, including the famous Shepheard's and Continental Hotels. They are magnificent buildings and it is only permitted of officers and nurses to enter. I continued along the street in which they are till I came to a bridge over the Nile ( You have a P.C. of it, which Les sent - a tall native policeman standing in the street in the foreground) The Nile is a splendid broad stream at this place. On the other side there are fine gardens along the bank. Here one sees many of the well educated Egyptians reading and walking (some arm in arm) This writing place is in the open air alongside a skating rink on which there are always dozens of brawny sun-tanned Australians flying round playing hockey. There are also a good tea rooms in the vicinity where one can enjoy good tea and coffee and good cake. They are singing out that the mail is about to close so I shall have to stop now. With love to all, Your loving son, Jim. P.S. I am trying to locate Les through the Base Records' Office. I shall shortly know his whereabouts. Zeitoun Cairo, Egypt.

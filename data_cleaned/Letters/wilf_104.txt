The pleasure my dear, toreceive it just as it was packed by your ownhands with the little note inside, & all that itmeant was more than I can describe & I justdid wish to give you a real kiss & thank you,but as the seas divide us I can only send it byletter. It seemed to bring you so near & thelittle kitchen where the cakes were made, but thoughwe long to be near each other we must do ourduty still, my dear. as hundreds, of othersare at present & be grateful that we arestrong & healthy. The socks made by you, atthe sewing meeting & both lots of tobacco arrivedtogether so I had three parcels fromyou all at once. It is idle to thank youmy dear, you know how much I appreciateit. I have settled down after my trip to Cairo & am quite in the normal routine again.If there is a small interval between this &my next, you know how uncertain mailsare nowadays so just be patient. Someletters go by England & some direct Ifancy & then our facilities here are not, attimes very good though they have been recently.In much haste tonight my dear, just wroteto thank you, a great big hug & a kissfromYour loving sonWilf.

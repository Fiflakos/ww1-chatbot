Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 17 October 1918 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Damascus Nationality: Australian Text: 17-10-1918.My dear mother,I must try to set out for yourbenefit the rather interesting experiences we havehad during the past month as it is just a monthago today since we left our camp in the olivetrees. When I wrote you from there I was of courseaware that operations were coming on but couldnot divulge anything in my letters as the strictestsecrecy was observed. It was however mostinteresting to watch the preparations for the offensivewhich entailed a vast amount of work & uponwhich the success of the action largely depends.You remember when I told you of our leavingthe Jordan Valley for a spell - in reality wemoved right across near to the sea & there hidfor a month among some very large orchards& olive groves admirably suited for the purpose.Then the men trained hard as they hadjust been given swords for the first time & there we equipped & prepared foroperations. Then as the days drew on we watchedthe gradual piling up of troops in thisarea - all done secretly - & so completewas our air mastery that I only oncesaw a hostile aeroplane trying tospy out our intentions. I have neverseen such a concentration of troops &artillery at one spot. Then one night wegot into our allotted positions behind theinfantry & then with a pouf! bang! at4 o'clock in the morning the avalanche waslaunched at the astonished Turk. Hehad concentrated the large part ofhis force in the Jordan valley & his linewas comparatively weakly held. Thepreliminary bombardment lasted onlyfor an hour or two & then the infantrywent over & through the Turk withfew casualties & when they hadbroken the line our turn came & we were sent forward to our previouslyallotted tasks with the utmost rapidityHow we went!!!! The advance mountedtroops must have covered 35 miles that day.The pace was frequently a trot, sometimes agallop. The whole object was to get roundto the enemy's rear before he got away.You see we had broken his line near the sea& then dashed up the coast for a certaindistance then turned to the right & crosseda range of mountains by the only decent pass& reached the plain of Esdraelon justabout hour before the Turks who werecoming along to hold the pass succeededin reaching it. Then on to El Afulahthe main railway junction & laterto Nazareth. Our little lot howeverwhen we crossed the pass turned to theSoutheast & made for Jenin where theroad from Nablus comes out on tothe plain of Esdraelon & first is the head of the column of the Turks retreatingfrom Nablus entered the place from theSouth entered the town from the South,our boys sword in hand galloped intoit from the North. What consternation therewas - 7000 Turks & Germans surrenderedto a Regiment!!! When they saw howmany they had taken our fellows wereafraid they might not be able to holdthem. The rest of the Brigade hadcome up then & another one was sentacross at the gallop to help.Coming along next day I was astoundedat the spectacle of so many prisonerswith their peculiar forms of transport.Some were walking, some riding in coachesor funny old Turkish carts, some oncamels, some on donkeys, all verytired, thirsty & dejected. The Germanslooked infinitely superior to the Turk.Say what we will of them - I have found a good deal to admire in thosewe have seen here - they are sturdy hardworking & well disciplined & fight like tigersin a comer. There is no love lost between them& the Turk, they live apart & always haveseparate hospitals & Ambulances & theGerman more or less despises the Turk &as far as I can see the Turk hatesthe German.But I must tell you my own personalexperiences before arriving at Jenin.I had direct control over the motor Ambulancesof our own Division & took them roundto our starting point & left them there forfurther orders as the route we were takingwas across country which was sandy& practically roadless & I didn'tlike risking them over it. So Col Fowlermy acting chief & I set off in a lightcar to explore it taking with us amotor bicycle to send back word to the Motor Ambulance whether to come on ornot. We soon decided that it wasnot fit for our cars & decided to waitkeep them back until Tul Keramhad fallen & then send them alongthe main metalled road throughit. We had broken the line on the seawardside, the defences in front of Tul Keram being then unbrokenbut our line was to swing round & take TulKeram from the flank & then the mainmetalled road would be available for us.So I gave orders for the Ambulance to waituntil Tul Keram had fallen & then proceedup the metalled road & meet me there.Col Fowler & I pushed on & reached theW. Iskanderuneh that night & heproceeded on with the Division while Iwaited till morning to collect anymedical personnel & wheeled vehicles whichmight be stranded about there &direct them on. I found plenty of them as the heavy sandy going had beeneven too much for the horse drawn vehicles& they had great trouble in getting through.I collected what I could & sentthem on, & then rode across to TulKeram about 8 miles East of where I wasto pick up the Motor Ambulances. TulKeram was in a horrid mess - the remainsof the battle were everywhere, dead Turks& horses, horseless vehicles, packs ofabandoned transport - in one placeabout 300 wagons in a transport park,prisoners tired thirsty woebegonetrooping in by their hundreds -wounded & sick going to hospitalderelict trains in the station & lotsof rolling stock, with the contentsof the trucks & carriages scatteredabout the station yard in fact allthe features which one now associateswith the first day of a captured town The enemy usually destroys his wells &there is a day or two of water shortage till it canbe remedied everyone is busy with hisown work & at first all is confusionuntil this is superseded by the calmorderliness of army workings - each manto his own task & order supervenes on out ofchaos. My Motor Ambulances did not turnup until almost evening but I thenset off with them in chase of the Divisionreaching Khas Sumrah that night wherewe camped & made our evening meal.I slept well wrapping my mosquito netabout my head as it was a verymosquito haunted & malarious spot& started off after an early breakfastat 6 a.m. next day. We left thecoastal plain at Sumrah turningsharply East & crossed the rangeof hills which runs up from themountain range about Nablus &Jerusalem to Haifa & divides the coastal plain which runs down throughJaffa & Ludd x the plain of Sharonfrom the plain of Esdraelon whichlies on the other side of this range& which is watered by the brook Kishonof the Bible. We gradually mountedthe range & entered a narrow defilewhich our troops had crossed 24hours previously & which the rapidityof our advance had prevented theTurks from holding - & just as wellas it would have been a very strongposition - & finally reached the top& had our first glimpse of the plainof Esdraelon. It is a marvellousplain running from the sea right downto the Jordan & surrounded byhills on both sides - those roundNablus to the South & those roundNazareth to the North.Mount Tabor (the Mount of Transfiguration & where also Napoleon fought a great battle,rises abruptly out of the plain as a rounded hill.Nazareth lies in the hills to the North & is plainlyvisible from the plain.I found our headquarters at El Lejjun & afterconsultation with Col Fowler proceeded straighton to Jenin in a S.E. direction. Then Ifound my old Ambulance with it's quartersin a German Hospital & I took over controlof the general medical organisation of thetown. There were four Turkish hospitalsfilled with sick & wounded Turks - mostlymalaria cases, several Turkish doctors & agood many orderlies. The German hospitalhad a German doctor in charge, a numberof German orderlies & 11 German sisters - trainednurses who had been at Nablus & had attemptedto escape by Jenin but were caught there.Then we had our own Ambulance with afew sick & wounded. The difficulty wasto feed the Turks & Germans about 400 in all & all short of rations, but I managed toget some grain; had a mill & bakerystarted & got some bread delivered.Then I requisitioned 10 sheep & got ridof the shadow of starvation. We also locateda drug store & a sufficiency of drugs & dressingsin it. The next thing was to get moremedical orderlies as the Turks were short- these we managed to get from among theprisoners. I took for myself an officea fine room in the front of the Turkishhospital & had a bed rigged up therewith nice clean things on it & thoughteverything fine. But goodness! when Ilay me down to sleep the fleas started& nearly eat me alive & in the end Ihad to bolt & sleep in an adjacentgarden. I never experienced such fleas.Things were now going fairly well. TheTurkish hospital was run by their Senior officerwhom I had put in charge, the German hospitalby their own doctor & our own Ambulance by its Seniorofficer & each daily rendered to me theirreturns & numbers in hospital so that I might ration them from local resources.We found large stores of Turkish bully beef agood deal of champagne & a soda waterfactory. So our patients were fairly welloff & ourselves too for that matter. I hada very busy time but it was enjoyeable.After 3 days I received word to jointhe Division & leave the place in chargeof Col Stuart & I then proceededto El Afuleh where the Division thenwas & found them living fairly comfortably in therailway buildings there. Afuleh was, as I have saidtheir main railway centre & our primary objective asit was the junction of the railway from Tul Keram &Nablus with the line to Haifa & when we got itHaifa was cut off from railway communication. There were millions of sandflies at Afuleh, a lot of buildingsx a good deal of rolling stock & engines & a lot of ordnancestores. The plain of Esdraelon is exceedingly fertile & malariousrich black soil which is hard & cracked in summer& covered with the remnants of crops & in winter isa huge bog into which one sinks indefinitely.Next day I started off again to try & reachSemak xx at the South end of thesea of Tiberias where one of our Brigadehad had a stiff scrap & a number ofcasualties. I went down to Busan firstin the Jordan valley and attempted to go Northto Semak but the road was impossiblefor cars & I gave up the attempt & returnedtired as could be to Afuleh. Next morningat 0600 I started again this time bya different route following the mainroad through Nazareth among the hills to thetown of Tiberias & then round the Southernshores of the lake to Semak. Nazareth isa pretty place rather like Bethlehemsituated among huge hills & clustering on their slopes. It has some fine buildingsmainly used as hospitals of late,& generally built of greyish stone. Itis said that it was the main Turkish hospitalbase & certainly is high & healthy but verydifficult of approach on account ofthe steep hills. The road ascends steeplyeven after Nazareth then drops again & runsalong a valley - very pretty covered with crops& trees, then ascends again & runs along aplateau & suddenly the sea of Tiberiasbursts upon one thousands of feet below.The view is one of the most magnificent Ihave seen - the still blue waters of the lakeencircled by huge mountains, around & thewhite houses of the Town of Tiberias clusteredon it's Southern shore. The descent is terriblysteep into the town & then we turned to theright & skirted along the Southern shorestill we reached the outlet of the Jordan fromthe lake. Semak where the wounded werelies about a mile beyond the Jordan & unfortunatelythe bridge was broken down & the ford rather deep for motors so I hailed a manon the opposite side to bring over his horse & Imounted behind him & thus forded thestream & rode on to the hospital. I asked themto load their wounded as quickly as possible intotheir xx horsed Ambulance wagons & take themacross the ford thus & then transfer themto the motors. While they loaded the wagonsI had some lunch with Single &Anderson (my quondam rival at the Varsity)& then went off with the wagons & madeall speed to retrace my steps to Nazarethwhere a hospital had seen opened. Whata tedious return trip especially as we methundreds of wagons on the narrow road& it seemed a long 30 miles. Howeverwe reached Nazareth just after darkwith all the badly wounded & got theminto good comfortable beds in the Frenchhospital. It must have been a good70 mile trip altogether that day fromAfuleh to Semak & back to Nazareth& I was a very tired man. Howevera good nights rest did wonders & next day I made for Tiberias again.On reaching that place I received ordersto collect all the lightly sick & woundedfrom Semak who remained to Tiberias& evacuate by motor lorry. There were stillsome 60 people sick & wounded but moreserious, so with my motors & Col Singleshorse wagons & camels we got them allacross safely. I had a Turkish hospitalcleaned out for them & had brought alongwith me ten men from Nazareth as theadvance party of our Ambulance whichwas moving up from there & with the aidof these ten we made some tea (we hadno utensils with us but we improvised)dressed any that required it - withdressings from the Turkish pharmacy& made them as comfy as possible underthe circumstances. Next day I movedon leaving Capt Humphries to completethe evacuation to Nazareth by aid ofmotor supply lorries which were expected topass at any moment. That day Ireached the crossing of the Jordan. on the North side of the sea of TiberiasThe Turks had damaged the bridge butour engineers repaired it. The hill onthe other side was terrific - I got tangledup with a lot of transport so pulled offthe road & camped for the night.I will conclude this letter here mydear & continue the account in mynext. But before I finish let me tellyou of the transport (Turkish) we hadpassed on the road. At & aboutJenin & between there & Afulah theroad was absolutely blocked withtransport - motor lorries in scores,wagons, touring cars, motor Ambulances-such a sight I have never seen.It was all trying to escape when ouraeroplanes descended on it &absolutely frightened the drivers fromtheir seats, they created such enormoushavoc. And of course the cavalrycoming in at the rear cut off theirretreat also. But everywhere along the roads even as far as Nazareth& Tiberias were wagons & motor lorriesscattered in an apparently endlesssuccession.Interruption here my dear.I will continue my account from thisonwards later as this letter is becomingtoo bulky & tedious for you to read.Lots of love to all & an extrashare for motherfromHer loving sonWilf Nothing further yet about that boat totake me home, one always has towait a bit & the stunt has ratherupset things for the time (I mean operations), but I can expectit at any time now I think soyou may receive a cable to sayI'm coming at any old time. The letter was too bulkyso the first half hadto be put in anotherenvelope my dear.Hope they both arrivesafelyWilf 2nd part of letter

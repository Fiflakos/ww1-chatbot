27 Chesilton Road, Parsons' Green London, SW6, 28. 5. 1918. Author: James Joseph Makin Location: 27 Chesilton Road Parsons Green LondonDate: 28 May 1918 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father,I am afraid this isgoing to be rather a rough old letter. I have come home early and gone to bed, but now that I am in bed I feel like writing a letter. Things are much as usual in London. I am still doing my job on Hdqrs week in week out without much variation. The weekend before last I went down to Bournemouth for a couple of days, the Monday (this Monday)being a public holiday. We were fortunate enoughto strike two successivefine days and had agood time. We went inswimming in the Eng.Channel. The waterwas very cold but theswim was very enjoyablenevertheless. Last SundayI went to an exhibition of Australian War Pictures at the Grafton Galleries. They are very fine indeed, and will eventuallybe seen in AustraliaI suppose. The Germans have madea further big attack, and tonight's paperreports them acrossthe River Aisne. Theyhave achieved a goodinitial success andit remains to be seenif they will be able to follow it up.I had a letter fromLeo a few days ago.He is well and goingstrong. He has noword of going back toFrance as yet.I think it is better tosend my papers direct. It will save the doc. agood deal of trouble inbringing them up fromWestcliff. He is a very busy man thesetimes at the Admiralty, and I seldom seehim at all. Theair raid last Sunday night week on London wasthe first I have missed. There were over 200casualties. The light is failing soI must bid you goodnight. Fondest love from Jim.

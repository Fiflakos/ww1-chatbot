Author: William Birdwood Date: 5 October 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Dad,I have been goingto write to you lately, but sofar have had no oportunityuntil now, & even now havenot much time.We have just come out of theline for 2 or 3 days, & expectto go back again very soon.The bad weather may possiblyhold up the advance a little,which is a pity, for we weregoing ahead steadily and surely,& it was looking as if Fritzmust withdraw a good deal& find another line of resistance.It is very hard going, &seems to be getting worseevery day - new inventions,& harder fighting.Shall be glad when the Yankscome in & ease the pressurea little.The R.S.M had H.Q. outon squad drill this afternoon I get very little drill at anytime, & therefore am very stale.We got over it however!That yarn about the 5,000Australians getting leave to visitAus: has recently been contradicted,- I never did take much noticeof the rumour. - it has been floatingabout for a long time now - Itwould be a very difficult almostimpossible thing to do just now.Don't attempt to do more workthan you are phisically ableto do - we can managesomehow without: So if youfind work is too much for youleave it alone.I am enclosing a photo ofthe memorial we (the Pioneers)erected at Posieres in memoryof our lads who fell there.The name plate is screwedon to the wooden cross, & thephoto is an enlargement of the plate. I stamped those names onmyself with single letter dies -it took me quite a long time asyou will see. The plate is ofaluminium, & part of a 'plane.Hope you are all well, &having as good atime as possible.I am still in good healthso far.With Love to Chickie& Mother & yourselfYour affectionate Son,Will.

WImborne20.2.1917My Dear General BirdwoodSo my many thanks for yourvery kind letter of sympathy on the loss of thegood old Cornwallis. We were struck by 2 torpedoes,the 1st at 7.58 am, & the 2nd about 900 ___As you may imagine, the discipline & conduct ofofficers & men were splendid. We hadspecial stability arrangements for uprightingthe ship when heeled, they worked admirably& as soon as the ship was upright boats weregot out. In the meantime the destroyer escort kept oncircling the ship so as to keep the submarine down,& about 8.30 I got her alongside putting about 600 men into her & the final140 into boats.they were all well clear when 2nd. torp. hit ship though I remainedonboard as I wanted to see the state ofdeck below & also paid a visit to my aftercabin to make certain of security ofconfidential books - & on going forwardto the fore & aft bridge the 2nd. torpedo hitus envelopping me in a cloud of water,steam & flying debris, however providentiallyI was unhurt & was able to climb downthe side & drop into my boat before the old shipturned turtle & sank. The 2nd. torp only missedthe destroyer by a few feet. Ultimately I orderedall boats crew into Destroyers who took usall safely to Malta -I was so thankful to knowthat barring the loss of 13 lives by explosion& so proud of conduct of officers& men that I had the blow much lessened.I am now on leave & at moment ofwriting laid up with acute bronchitis &gas poisoning, so am rather piano, howeverit is great happiness to see my childrenagain though 1 son is at school & theother in the "Benbow", the latter I'm glad tosay is fairly happy. As a Court of Inquirywas held & the young bullies got a dressingdown & kicked out of the ship. I dont knowwhat my fate will be. I lost one job throbeing sick. I had a very nice letter fromAdl De Robeck. in reply to my yarn telling him aboutthe ship being sunk, but he said that he had nopower whatever in the way of appointments in his battlesquadron as that lies entirely [[?]]the Adty which alas for me though good for thecountry is entirely composed of Grand Fleet. officers,So there is nothing doing for DardanellesCaptains I expect, however I'm not proud,& will do any job I'm called upon to do.I can't do more than satisfy my ownAdmirals afloat, for the rest I must wait.Please excuse this scrawl written inbed. Im looking forward to the GreatOffensive & only wish I could be yourADC or orderlyYours very sincerely,AP Davidson

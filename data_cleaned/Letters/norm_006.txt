Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: S S Shropshire Near Port Said Date: 28 November 1914 Nationality: Australian Text: Sunday 28th November, 1914.Dearest MotherHope you got my last letter fromAden alright; I have not much to tell you thistime as the trip to here has been uneventfulAden is not much of a place, & certainlyno place for a white man to live in, altho' thereare some there. The houses there are very muchlike those at Colombo & the inhabitants areJews, Somali's, & Arabs. The place is themost hilly & rugged place one could imagine& the natives mostly travel in a "jig jog" trotlike Chinamen. The vehicles are drawnby Camels & these creatures are very numerousThe Jews & Arabs came out to us in theirboats & sold good of all descriptions atof course impossible prices & came in forsevere handling of the chaps tongues.Matches 1/- a dozen & prices like that.It is interesting to watch the Arabs coal ourship, they all jabber like a lot of monkeys &everybody is yelling at once & nobody takes anynotice of what the other says, but they can getthrough the work alright, & the most wonderfulthing is, they worked all day & never had abite to eat, & it was after 8 o'clock when the tug boat came to take them off. We left thereafter loading & passed Perrim & Hells Gates& here we could see the hulls of wrecked boats& apparently this place is not ill named. Comingthrough the Red Sea, we passed a big boat packed withpeople & our Warship went out & pulled herup with a shot in front of her bows, & whenshe stopped, she proved to be a boat loadof Pilgrims coming back from Mecca after someAnnual Religious Festival, so she was allowedto go on. We had a death on board 2 daysago; one of the Ammunition Column chaps hadthe measles but got down in the dumps & diedso we buried him 2 hours later. It is veryimpressive, as all Ranks fell in in their properplaces & a shoot is pushed out over the side& attached by ropes so that it can betilted. The body was placed in a packingcase & some firebars & cable chain packedin with him & holes drilled in the box toadmit the water, & when the Coffin wasplaced on the shoot, our boat pulled outof the line & stopped & then the service wasread & the shoot tilted & down he wentwith a splash & the boat goes on just asbefore. He came from Gippsland. & the Dr saidthat if he had any heart, he would have gotbetter.There is some beast just a fewCabins down that is playing on aconfounded mouth organ.I can't imagine any punishmentbad enough for him. We have just been told that we go to Egypt(Cairo) & we expect to land there on Tuesday.Cairo is about 12 hours train journey fromAlexandria & after completing our trainingthere we proceed to the south of France & therego to the front. Most of the fellows are ratherdisappointed at not seeing England first, butif we went to England, we would not seeEgypt. Personally I am pleased as I amjust simply chock & full up of the boat& every body else is. It has been a verycalm voyage & I have not been sick since leavingAlbany, but it is terribly monotonous & onewakes up in the morning anything but freshbut we improve after breakfast. It isfairly hot in the Red Sea, but I haveknown hotter days in Melbourne. Thereason why we go to Egypt is that it istoo wet in England to do our training thereWell I think I have told you all the newsat present Mother so with fondest love toeverybody at home & elsewhereI remainYour loving sonNormanGive my loveto Floss RobbieI hope you are all well.

Author: J W McCay Date: 3 February 1917 Location: London Nationality: British Text: 30 Bruton StW3.2.1917Dear General ,Thank you for your two letters of 27th &30th Jany, & still more for the kind things you cabledto the minister about me.I am sorry you do not agree with my actionin cabling myself, or rather with what I cabled, butI felt (& feel still) that it ought to be done. Atany rate, there it is, & I must stand by it.I recognise thoroughly that you had to give theminister your views about Morris work at Salisbury,whether it affected my chances or not: as indeedit must, once you had decided not to appoint aGOC in England for A.I.F. there.I think Legge's strong objection to being recalledto Australia is that he considers the recall to bethe result of a mistaken view about his health, &that he is to suffer for the mistake. I do notknow whether he shares my feeling that G.H.Q.treated us both rather cavalierly, & my curiosity asto whether regulars are treated in the same way.As the action was taken, I think myself thatSmyth was more than entitled to a Division, & tome he is as completely A.I.F. now as if he hadsailed with us from Australia: his appointment cannot justly be resented by anyone.I am sorry to learn that your chest is againtroubling you. You must not get ill, for 1st Anzacwithout you is hardly thinkable.Little as you relish the idea of giving evidencebefore the Commission, you are not likely to escapethe ordeal; & your coming over will give me thechance of seeing you again soon.Will you please remember me to White.With all fond wishes to yourself,I amYours most sincerely,J.W.McCay

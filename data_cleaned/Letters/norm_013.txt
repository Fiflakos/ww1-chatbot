Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Mena Camp Cairo Egypt Date: 9 January 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Best Love to Flos RobbieMena Camp, Cairo, Egypt 09/01/1915.Dearest Mother & all at HomeThis has been a red letterweek for me as I received no less than 6 letters at once &of course I was the happiest man alive. I got one fromyou, one from Mab & a Photo, one from May Tilton, 1 onefrom Alice Cutler, & one from a Glaciarium Girl. Poorold Jack Hall got none & nearly cried. I can only endorseGeorge's remarks about letters from Home Sweet Home. If wehave something nasty for dinner, we go & read our lettersagain & this is as good as a dinner; Fortunately we getthe best of grub to eat & have little to complain aboutin this respect. We have had a busy week this week& the weather has been vile in the desert & the duststorm, which lasts 4 days, played the very devil withour eyes. We left the guns & wagons out there all night& left a party of one Sergeant & 10 Gunners to look afterthem and to dor the Gun Laying Tests under the Adjutant,whilst the Drivers & Horses went back to Camp forthe night. I was left out the first night & afterdoing my Laying Test, I slept under a Gun Limber thatnight I thoroughly enjoyed myself, & after getting up at7 am next morning, completed the Test before the restof the men and horses arrived. I am pleased to tellyou that I was the only one to Qualify in the Brigade & I might state that I was the only Sergeant to pass.I have had no practise of Laying since I joinedthe Expeditionary force & of course was right outof form, & not only that, it was sprung on the Sergeantsall of a sudden. We had no sooner finished withthe Gunners, when the Adjutant said, "now the Sergeants".I felt anyhow, but as soon as I got to work, I feltconfident, & finished far before the Sergeants of the otherBatteries & all my Sights were set correctly so got Fullmarks. The Dust storm we experienced is something awfulas there is a continuous blinding of fine dust all the time& what with the whole of 3 Field artillery Brigades withall their horses and vehicles doing manoevres, one can'tsee his hand in front of him, & the Dust has got into allthe fine bearings of the Gun, however, we have had theGuns to pieces & thoroughly cleaned & start shooting withlive shell on Monday next. One of the mares inmy Gun Team slipped a Foal during the night, but I amsorry to say that the Foal died almost immediately.Last Sunday afternoon, we paid a visit to theZoo, & enjoyed ourselves immensely, altho the MelbourneZoo is even better than the one we saw. After thiswe dined "biggly" & then trammed it home to sleep.We got several papers & pictures from the "Leader"of the Expedry Force & it was quite a relish to see aMelbourne paper once more, as the "Egyptian Mail" is a beastly "rag". Harry Braithwaite got Mabsphoto & is very pleased to know that she goes & seeshis Mother every now & then. We are all anxiouslylooking forward to going to the "Front" & having a"Box on" with the Germans, as we have been doingthe new Gun pit work & trenches of a night & Ican assure you that once a Gun is dug in, it isa difficult matter to see anything at all from theoutside & this method had been found mosteffective at the front & the percentage of casualtieshave dropped from 75% to 5% since the outbreakof the war, in the Artillery. I am sending yousome more Post Cards along with this letter &I hope you got the box of Chocolate which Iregistered & sent to you last mail. I writeas often as possible, which is once a week, & willtry & keep this up & hope you will let all kindenquirers for me know that I am quite well &appreciate their good wishes & am sorry I can'twrite to them all. With fondest love to all,& self, at home & elsewhere I amYour loving Son,Norman

Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: Lord William Birdwood Date: 28 March 1916 Nationality: New Zealand Text: Dear General Birdwood,With regard to our many telegrams whichhave passed between us on the question of the use of a certaincypher, it is a curious thing that you were permitted to useit and its use was prohibited here so far back as last December.As soon as you told me that you were using it, I telegraphed tothe Secretary of State for War to ask if we could also use it,because all correspondence with you has had to pass through me inanother cypher which I alone had, and all routine work of theDefence Office so far as correspondence with you was concernedhas had to pass through my hands, which I can tell you at a timelike this, as you will well realize, was pretty "thick".With regard to another subject which I telegraphed to youabout, I frankly do not understand the methods of censorshipwhich takes place in Egypt. I get personal and secret messagesfrom the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies enjoining me to the utmost secrecy, and yetcode telegrams and even scarcely veiled open telegrams areallowed to pass the Censors both in Egypt and England. I getinstructions to re-censor here, and that is all very well up toa certain point, but it naturally means that information whichis considered most secret passes through a further number ofhands; nor is this all, because it entails an enormous amountof work to the Censors here, (and we have none too many of themavailable) whereas the whole matter could much more expeditiouslybe dealt with at the office of origin.I think it well that you should know what both myself andmy Government think of this question, because having corresponded with you only by cable you may have thought me somewhat fussyon the matter and one cannot put all that one thinks into telegrams.We are all very much pleased at the report that GeneralSpens has forwarded with regard to the training which has takenplace of the troops in New Zealand and which points to thefact that you and senior officers are pleased with what has beendone in this respect in this Dominion. Yours sincerely,Liverpool. GOVERNMENT HOUSE DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND [Personal]

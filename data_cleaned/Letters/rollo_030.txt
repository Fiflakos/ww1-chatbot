Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Gaba TepeDate: 2 June 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Just a line to let you know I am at theFront - this is my second day in the Trenches.I can't write much - but I can't realisehow our boys effected a landing. It was asimply marvellous feat.I am posted to C Co. - under Capt. Shaw. Youcan imagine my joy in meeting Cornish & Gilesespecially as they had been 'Killed' - it shows howlittle credit one must give to 'rumors'.My Co. are mostly Broken Hill men - ourtrench is called "Sulphide St," Oxide, &c. - Ourmen, all Australians, are well dug in, andwill take a great deal to shift us. Dug outsand trenches are not bad in fine weather -but when the wet sets in - things will bevery different..We are constantly under fire night & day - butare so well dug in that we suffer little loss -we lose most when out patrolling - or from'snipers' who play the very devil with us.I have already had some close shaves, & one'shair rises now & then to hear 'ping - thud - justabove one's head in the bushes up top. 64 shellswere lobbed in a small space in 4 minutes a dayago, & not one of our chaps was hurt.We have bully beef & dog biscuits, but we arecheerful & await the orders to 'advance',I've lost the habit already of ducking whenshell or shrapnel metal burst just overhead.

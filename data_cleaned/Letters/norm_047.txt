My temperature is normalagain & after a fortnight of liquidfoods, I am on light boiled eggs &bread & butter? & custard & jellies.I also get a small bottle of Stouteach night at 8pm to fix me up forthe night, so I'm not doing too bad.I expect to be on Porridge & Chickensoon, but those are luxuries forEnteric patients. The nurses hereare English & are not a patch on theAustralian Girls, they go about theirwork too seriously & never smile or joke like our girls. They are very stictwith the Patients too. They know nothingabout Australia & think it must be awild desolate place. Yet they preferAustralian patients to Tommies.They are nearly all Tommies here &there is 1 New Zealander, so I have someone (colonial) who I can understand. TheTommies all speak the most peculiarlanguage & are very difficult to understand.All my Mail is still at Anzacso I've no news from home yetNow Mother dear, don't worry aboutme for I'm quite alright & will be doingthe "heavy" in England soon, so keep your"pecker" up. Give my love to everybody.Mab, Rupert, Chas, George, Floss, Aunts &Uncles & all enquirers & accept abig whack from your loving son,Norman. I do not know whatunit I will be withwhen I return from Englandas a man is struckoff the strength if he isaway for 2 monthsfrom his battery, so I'llbe looking for a job, eh

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: France Date: 23 November 1916 Nationality: Australian Text:The Brigadier complimented me about the conditionof my trenches - & that suits me better than gettinga couple of M.C.A small mail just came in, bringing two splendidparcels, for me, one from you - the other from Boltons.Thanks for them - & also for the cabled birthdaygreetings. We have just my birthday dinner inthe celebrated Delville Wood - soup -currant jelly,curried bully beef stew, plum pudding, & crystallisedfruit to top-off. Supper tonight will have cocoaand shortbread, while the chocolate supply willkeep us going for a day or two yet - so you cansee Ive had a most famous feast. Boltons senton some chocs & shortbread - a fine body-belt knittedby Cis, & a warm pair of gloves. Ill write to them assoon as I finish this.You must pardon this short note - but takeno news as good news & things as O.K. I willwrite again in about a weeks time - & hope to beback in France as I am now, at that time.I will close with all good wishes for goodfortune, health, &c - & much love to you all fromRolloI am in tip-top health.

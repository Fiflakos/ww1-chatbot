Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Nationality: Australian Text: Kind regards to you. Redburg (Major) looked abit washed out after his first experience in the firingline - but Hamilton, Short, Giles were the sameas ever. Giles is a fine man about equal to Herbert.I saw most of my old platoon, most belong toother platoons & are wearing stripes. Hamiltonis not now with C. & one of sgts remarked 'the officersin C are not the ones we used to have'. Many of theC. boys wanted to come here - or follow 'Jack'. Wehave a name which the 3rd Brigade is proud of &Col. Weir reckoned we'd done him "proud."Aeroplanes in the early morning & evening remind meof a mosquito swarm. We send up anything up to20 : 1 as regards the Huns - and the shells usedin bringing down one aeroplane are legion. Itis marvellous the escapes which each plane has.Every aviator who does a trip over Fritz deserves aD.S.O - as he must get anything up to 200 shellsshot at him every five minutes - so when you see6 aeroplanes brought down - you can reckon each ofthose 6 clipped a shell after dodging some thousands.We have not seen any Zeps. yet - but Fritz hasa fair supply of Observation balloons. I saw ourguns bring down 5 one evening."Raids" are the latest stunts here. The Old Brigade gotoff 2 last week - just in our immediate front.

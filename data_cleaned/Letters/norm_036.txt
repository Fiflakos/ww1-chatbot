Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli Peninsular Turkey Date: 20 July 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & all at Home,I received another most welcomeletter from you & Mab, also a Table Talk & Punch so thisgives us great joy & helps to fill in the time beautifully.I cannot tell you what joy it gives me to get your lovelylong letters & I read them over & over again. It is just the samewith the rest of the boys, & on Mail days, one can find a chapin every little corner having a quiet little read.I am pleased to tell you that I am in the very best of nick &I hope you are all in the same health at home.We are still keeping the Flag flying here & defy the Turksto leave, & just to be nasty, we are going to bundle them outneck & crop shortly. Down at Achi Baba the bombardmentis continuous & one simply marvels at the way the Turks canhold out against shelling they get, & it goes on night & day.The Howitzer batteries are relieving us of a tremendousamount of work & they make a terrible mess of the Turks trenchesOur Infantry are still thirsting for more bayonet work& hope they will soon get their wish fulfilled. They knockabout the trenches almost naked & are as brown as berries,but quite cheerful. Body lice are our worst enemies &a lot of chaps wear their clothes inside out & look dead funny I was sorry to read of Rupert having cut his foot & hope itis quick better. Tell him I got his letter & I hope he willwrite me some more. Tell him the Australians give theold Turks what for & plenty of nice bayonet.I do not know who sends me the Punch each week,but if it is Jack Harthing, then I hope you will thank himKindly for me. I have received no parcel from Uruchelseawhich you mention, but hope they will not put themselves out,because I know they are so busy. Anyhow we get a veryliberal supply of clothing from Ordinance, so we dont do sobad. Food is fairly good & very plentiful, but we would give for some fresh green vegetables. We can draw pay hereevery now & then, but I don't draw any as one can't spendit, so its better in the book. I hope Charlie has got permanentwork ere this, & I also hope George has enlisted, because it would benice to meet him abroad. I cannot imagine what a soft bed withwhite sheets is like, it is nothing but "funk holes" & dug outs here.My Corporal tells me the war will end next month, so if hepredicts true, then I will sample some of the old original OnionStuffing Etc very soon. Let us hope his prophecy will come trueWell, mother dear, no more news at present, so willconclude, hoping all are enjoying the best of health; Pleasethank all kind enquirers & assurance give them our assurance ofBritish success. Best love to all at Home & an extra rationfor yourself from your loving sonNorman

Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 18 January 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Just had a nest from Ded Muttner & Juck Skephend L15B0 who are in canp about 2 nules from our lines. Both looked wellespecially Shepherd. Carthew is in Efts. for their battery - so with also be along soon. Auge numbers of troops are here - can't give figures. but we are all Aussies- and a hifty lot too. Ih He are having monolorious parade ground work just enough to keep us fit- and many gf us are getting special bombing instruction, for it looks as though we will be placed directly against the Hans before long Somehow I seem to feel that we the Aussies- are going to push the buitton that is going to drop the curtain on this war - I don't know why - but I have hopes still that we are going ant Germany- and then Wilhelm won't hesitale to say nuff.

If we get broken - well the ones who break us will be invincibles. If ontes Wellington was here to lead us we would bring about peace to this earth in six weeks! If Wolseley could have seen uo marching over his old battlefeld he would have turned an Australian too no one knows when our next got is on or where but my new man are all frightfully keen and anxious to get into a scrap, II will admit that many of ne old hands are beginning to hanker after powder again This life seems woo stor. I form fours to seems keoy damned silly monotonous as very boys say. To break down the monitory & put my cot. as cricket this afternoon but as the ritch was extremely sandy it was a real bowlers wicket New runs were made,

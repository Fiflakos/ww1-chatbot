Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 26 July 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: I have a fine old Sergeant - (Don Chisholme)with me - an old Cameron Highlander (79th) - & he wentthrough Egypt & S. African campaigns. He hasbeen wounded twice already, but is back, & lookingfor more. He is a fine old soldier, & with his aid Iam getting up a fine platoon.'Jacko' has begun throwing 'liquid' bombs atus - & he has gas too. We are ready with gashelmets - but devil a bit of gas to reply with.I doubt if this will pass the censor - I couldtell you much more if I liked to risk it - butit must remain untold for some time. With the helpof my letters (if you keep them) I will be able topatch up a full account of everything. Rollo

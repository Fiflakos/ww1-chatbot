Author: William Birdwood Location: FranceDate: 24 September 1916 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Dad We have a fine position here, so quiet& peaceful that it is hard to immagine that thereis a war on at all. Here the line is just beingheld, & a few raids carried out on the German lines,an air fight occasionally, & a few shells from usbut only a very few from Fritz.We are in supports, & our posi is in a wood,where we have some very comfy dugouts.I share a good one with the R.S.M, & it is a placeabout 12 x 14' inside, wooden floor canvas bunks,nice little brick fireplace, two desks & stools,pictures on the walls, two glazed windows &what is more marvelous, a sixpanelled pitch pinemoulded door, varnished. There is 3.6 of sandbags all round & on the roof, & the inside wallsare lined with hessian. When, on a coldnight we get a coke fire going, & the door closed,we are very comfortable.I have the pioneers constructing new dugouts whilewe are here, - the b'n is on fatigues for the front line. Being under & surrounded by trees we canmove about pretty freely: behind the position there isa fairly large cemetary, filled with white crosses, datingback to the early days of the war.We have been here 4 days now, & not a shell or bullethas come anywhere near us. The Hun has leftthis line very thin as far as artillery goes.I am sorry that your operations were not a success -will you have to undergo still moreThe weather for the past two days has been glorious, &the rain has held of nicely, allowing the mud, whichwas very thick, to dry up somewhat. There are somevery marshy patches arround here, & where much trafficgoes, duck walks have to be laid down.Have I addressed the envelope correctly? I was notsure of your writing. I have just heard that another Zepphas been brought down in London. Hurrah! - theseraids will become to expensive for them soon!We have them bluffed everywhere!Please give my Love to Mother & Chickie, same to yourselfFrom Yr Affectionate Son,Willy

Dept who took part in the East African campaign in the early stages of the war was returning from leave in England, and left London on October 11th. At 7.40am, on October 20ththe boat was torpedoed without warning in the Mediterranean and sank in seven minutes, but fortunately all passengers were saved being picked up by French torpedo boat although all baggage and cargo were lost. Fred states that he lost all he possessed with the exception of a pair of pyjamas (in which he had to take a lifeboat) his raincoat and wallet, and that the whole affair seems like a dream now but was real enough at the time. The passengers were landed in Algeria where they were well treated, and subsequently returned to England over land via Marseilles. He will make another attempt to dodge the submarines on November 18thwhen he sails for Mombassa on theBalmoral Castlevia the Cape, there being too much excitement in the Mediterranean at present.

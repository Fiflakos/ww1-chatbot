Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: Undated. Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Father & Mother, We have just recd. portion of a mail letter from Mum while at [[?Inglewood]], [[?am]] glad to know Harry & Mum had a good time at Houghtons]] but sorry that Dad wasn't able to be there too No news from here - except we're in "close support" - less than a mile from the firing line have met most of my old chums in the [[10th?]] - especially old Jack Hamilton who on Gallipoli was like a big brother to me. He is one of the best - Hope he gets through O.K. not seen [[?---clagan]], Weir, or Giles yet - but hope to soon. Was assured to read S. is on his way back.- I might have had such a holiday - but the "Sat. afternooners" are no good at this game - they are best at Mitcham teaching the boys to "[[f]] fours" What the d. is [[?Stippe?]] doing - still suffering from "shock" or is he a "recruiting officer." This will not be a very [[?newsy]] letter - except that the firing line is really dangerous, & D'. should be told so before its too late. Fritz uses shells, bombs, & aerial torpedoes, [[& at ]] [[times]] [[t--cks]] our trenches [[inside out]] & the occupants rotten - but fortunately we have artillery too & play the same game only we send about [[?? their ??]] their front line must get a hell of a time. The aerial torpedoes are awful things

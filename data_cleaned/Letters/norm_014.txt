It is simply great to comeback to camp after a hard days work to find 4or 5 letters waiting for me. I have read with deepinterest the different cuttings out of the newspapersalso the Church notes. Fancy having our namesin the Church Porch (Is mine there).We are all getting on fine here & are right upto our neck in hard work & all the the boys areworking great & are dying to have a fight withsomeone. Turks or Germans let em all come.Yesterday the 1st Brigade (New South Wales)did their shooting & to day, the 2nd Brigade(Victoria) that is us, had their turn, & I wantto tell you Mother, that our Battery has comeout on top of the lot in everything. Our advanceinto Action, we were told by the Head Quarters staff,was the finest they have ever seen. Our Officer saidit was a treat to see the way we trotted up all inLine & properly dressed & not a word was spoken. So quick was our fellows, that our horses had onlyjust time to get clear, when I got my first shot off.We had 3 different Targets & our Layers did wellat each & when we got "Cease Fire" Limber up" ourdrivers came up nice & steady with the Gun Limbersand as soon as we "Limbered up" we all trotted outof action just as well as we came in. The PermanentBattery (No 1) admit that they can't touch us. So yousee the old St Kilda battery have started well.I know you will all be pleased to know of our good start& we hope to spell our names in shells (18 pounder) in Berlinvery soon.We don't go into Cairo much now as the novelty hasworn off it a bit, but each Friday Afternoon we gointo Shepherds Hotel (Menzies of Cairo) & pay (5 Piastres) 1/-& have a lovely hot bath & a clean change of clothesthen a bonzer "blow out" (2/-) & then Motor Car to Camp.Nice isn't it. We generally go for a nice trip on Sundayafternoons & thoroughly enjoy ourselves. Now Mum, I havenot much news this time so hope you will excuse ashort letter. I hope all are well at home. Give my kindregards to everyone & best Love to all Ellsworths & anextra ration to your self. I am your loving sonNorman.

No. 1 Command Depot, Sutton Veny, Wiltshire, 9. 9. 1918. My dearest Mother & Father, Long before you receive this letter, which I write with a heart ready to break, You will have heard that poor old Les has made the supreme sacrifice for his country. I have been expecting this sad news for ten long days and nights, the tension during the last day or so being almost unbearable. When you hear of the nature of his wounds you will know, as I fully realize now, that it is better so. I had a wire from London this afternoon to say Les died at the 8th Gen. Hosp. Rouen yesterday. I have tried ever since leaving hospital (6 days) to get leave to get across and see him, but had not got a definite decision up till getting the wire today. Now I hope, dear parents, you will take a brave view of our misfortune, and try to derive some consolation in knowing that Les died in the most noble and honorable way, in defence of a his country, fighting in an unquestionably just cause. It is true that we only realize the most fearful and cruel aspect of war when our own blood is involved, and when sons are lost to their parents, and brothers to sisters and brothers. I thank God Les had not a wife and kiddies depending on him. You must be thankful you have still sons and daughters to be some comfort to you. I feel too upset to write further tonight, but I shall write again in a day or so, when I am more at ease. The memory of our last parting; the few brave words and strong grips; are is too fresh. Rest assured I shall find out all the news I can and let you know as soon as possible. I shall not be leaving England for at least a month, perhaps not at all now. Love to all from Your affectionate son, Jim. 1 DRL474 1/2 [*P.S. I do not forget dear Ruby is 20 today. It is a most shocking day here, a driving wind and rain in torrents. Jim.*]

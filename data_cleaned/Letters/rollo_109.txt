Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: FranceDate: 11 March 1917 Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Father & Mother,-During the past few daysI have recd two cables - both from [[Armitage]] &dealing with George's departure. The first one is from you Ithink saying G. leaves at end of Feb, &the other isfrom Perth - from G. himself I presume, saying heexpects to be in Eng. in 8 weeks - tho as thecensor cut out the date of sending - I am notable to gauge exactly the date of his arrivalI got my Sp Leave tovisit England - (commencing tomorrow) but I willnot take it now, &am writing in asking them tohold it over for 4 weeks or so - &thus meet him.I hope this can be managed for I have sacrificedmy ordinary leave - &it will take some shrewdcalculations to manage so as to see him during thefirst few days of his arrival &before joining his ship,&, it will require an immense amt of luck too.It takes a [[?]] from London 4 days to reach theBattn, &as it took 9 days to get a reply fromDiv. H.Q re my leave, two days from here toHavre, &then the chance of being held up thereby a 'closed' Channel - you can see I'll haveto be very lucky to meet him O.K. However I'm trusting to luck - I generallymanage to get along somehow. so I don't anticipatethe possibility of not seeing him.There's a vacancy for a Major in our Battn. &Seager,Moule, &myself is the order of senioritySeager is somewhat of a 'dud' just now, and isgoing to be superseded - Moule is Qrmaster, &as suchcan only take an hon. appointment - that leavesme next. & I've been told unofficially by MurrayFowler - (Adj. now) that my papers are "written up".I hope I am not promoted. Seager is a bitof a muggins in some respect - but he hasguts anyhow. He is a friend of mine too, &was superseded by Loutit - (now 2nd in Com) notlong ago, - so he would think we had him set&would be bitter about it. The O.C. has had tointerview him about his Co., & Seager is properlydown to things just nowI don't want to be promoted if it makes S,sore - I would rather do without it, - also itseems farcical to make a youngster like me havea position that among Regulars is only filledby a man of 35 or 40.I hope I don't get it:- as tho I'm prepared to acceptthe responsibility if necessary - I don't want eitherthe rank or the pay. I think the AIF. is overpaid already, especially the Caps. & Majors. I thinkit would be better if they knocked off some of our pay& gave extra to the N.C.Os - especially the L.Cpl. who onlygets the same as a private.I'm not promoted yet - so I'm happy &content.Fritz seems to be giving a fair amount of troubleup about Bapaume, but in a few days he willget a solid bump, &will have to fall back towardsCambrai at a tremendous rate - altho we don'texpect him to go much further back.This retirement is one of the benefits we havereaped after worrying him all the winter, and itis a reward to our boys who are following Fritzup for the last half of his retirementMarch winds here are 'Some' winds - knifeyand strong. I've only experienced one &that's enough.Occasionally snow falls, but we have plenty ofMUD- getting just the opposite extreme to the drysand of Egypt - just to make the happy mean.No more news just now - I'm as fit as afiddle, &sincerely hope you are all quite well too.Will write again in a day or so - &will now closewith very much love &best of all good wishes toyou for all sorts of good luck, prosperity &goodhealth- &much love to yourselves fromYour loving son,Rollo.

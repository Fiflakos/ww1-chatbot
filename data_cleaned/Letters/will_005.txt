I find I can write just one more line before we sail though I doubt if I can get it posted at once. I have now transferred to "Queen" & am sailing with Admiral Thursby directly - all as you can imagine full of excitement - and a truly wonderful scene it is here. Mudros Bay is a beautiful harbour and just crammed full of large transports - great battle ships - cruisers - destroyers - torpedo and boats - submarines etc. A lovely sea plane has been flying all round & over us for several hours testing her wireless - and now the great transports have begun to move quietly down & out of the harbour in turn - we follow at 12 and all meet at a rendez-vous behind the Island of Imbros before attacking. As the transports come down, such as have bands on board play them & the men all cheer & get counter cheers as they pass the battle ships & cruisers - Such fine fellows they all look as they crowd the sides & all just as keen as possible on starting fighting. It really makes a lump come in my throat as I watch them return their salutes to think of how many of them must fall almost at once - and how much too good so many of them seem to be cut off now - for I fear we are almost bound to lose heavily. Oh! for a cloudy night tonight - last night was exactly what I should have liked - and a dull morning, to let me get my ships along close to the shore unobserved & then no sun in our eyes as we land & have to do our firing early tomorrow morning. What a din & noise there will be with our ships [[?]] coming in broadsides & enemies shells coming along to us in return for we must stand very close in. Five hundred of my men come on board each of these battleships & we will all get a good hot meal about mid night which will last a long time. Then when we get quite close to the shore the ships boats which will all have been filled as we steam slowly along to within half a mile, will shoot ahead towed by picquet boats & I hope row men ashore in silence, though it is of course too good to hope we can do this unobserved, though I am hopeful I may get enough ashore to rush up & seize some high ground before the enemy have tumbled to it & been able to reinforce their posts there. The Admiral very kindly gave me his cabin last night & I felt I was having my last comfortable night for a very long time to come (though I have got no pyjamas with me) - and I have made the most of a decent hot bath, as I see precious little chance of any bed, bedding & change or bath for a very long time to come! We simply can land nothing & I am most anxious as to the feeding of the troops - however I'll manage somehow. I was rather touched on leaving the "Minnewaska" to come on board here, someone shouting out "Three cheers for our General"- and all the men rushing to the side to carry it on & cheer heartily. They certainly are a good uncomplaining lot & I do trust they will come through things well, for they have much fighting & nood hard ship before them all. Poor Onslow had a nasty go of neuralgia the last few days & yesterday I had to say he must remain on board with the horses to join me later when we get a chance of landing them & that I would take John McConaghy ashore instead. The result was wonderful and in half an hour Onslow had quite recovered & is now with me. I have made him get a few hard boiled eggs & dried figs (the latter grown on the island) for us which my servant, steward will carry which will be a very welcome addition to our bully beef & biscuits. The post is just off so I must close. Goodbye my own sweet wife. All my love. Ever your very loving old, Will.

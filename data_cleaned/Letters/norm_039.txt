Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli Peninsular Turkey Date: 14 August 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just a line to let you know that I amquite will & very comfortable, & I hope you are all the same.It is a great comfort to get your letters from Melbourne,& no matter how hard the chaps have been worked, a Mailfrom Australia is the most wonderful tonic in the world tobuck them up. We had just concluded a big battlewhen the Mail arrived, so we are all happy & thoroughlycontented now. One of our greatest enemies is Lice: Greatbig gray creatures who breed in thousands in the seamsof ours clothing, but just lately we have had littlewhite muslin or calico bags containing sulphur orsome other like powder, & I am glad to say it has hadthe effect of repelling the horrid things considerably.The poor Infantry chaps in the firing trenchessuffer very much from them & they are always to beseen at work with their thumb nails, altho' they don'twear much clothing either.Our chaps could do with a well earned rest now,& it is a great pity some of the Stay-at-Homes couldntcould just see them for a moment & decide if theyare not wanted immediately: Mother, you will be surprised to learn that I amseriously thinking of applying for a Commission, butas N.C.Os are unable, in this Brigade to qualify, so II have had to make an application to the DivisionalAmmunition Column (Captain Madden of the old No 9 Battery)is in charge & as I was formerly his trumpeter, I thinkthat I should stand a good chance, anyhow I amgoing to have a try & a good one too, & if I succeed, Iwill be able to work thro' to a Battery later on.Sergeant Major Dowsett has been transferred fromour Battery to Head Quarters Staff & we had anotherPermanent Sergeant Major from the Column inhis place, but he is probably leaving us to go toanother Brigade as Warrant Officer. We are alsoshort of a Quarter Master Sergeant, ours having beentransferred to Ordnance Depot.I will tell you in my next letter how I get on.I received letters from the following; Mother;George; Mabel; Charl; & May Tilton, & also a "TableTalk" from Mab, so you see I was quite occupied forsome time. Tell May Tilton that the Hospital ship"Gascon" is right alongside us & so I supposeNurse Tucker is on board. I do hope, Mother,you have got relief for your poor eyes by this. also Rupert, despite Georges kindness Idon't think his eyes were effectively treated inthe first instance, but I do hope it will notentail too much expense.Fancy Mab, knitting, "let 'em all come" everylittle helps & winter will soon be on us & Isuppose we will want it all.I am well off for socks at present, butcould do with some singlets & a sweater forthe coming season.Please Mother, don't forget to send the medicinechest which I spoke of in my previous letter, as weget diarrhoea, & other little ailments, & the blood getsout of order & then we get liverish & a trifle badtempered at times, but still we are a happy party.I am afraid I've told you all the news for thisweek, so I'll write as often as I can.I hope you are all well, give my kindestregards to all kind enquirers & my love to allrelations & best love to all at home.Tell me next time the name of our friends &their address in England.Well Mother dear, good-bye for thepresent with fondest love fromYour affectionate & loving sonNormanDon't forget our dinner

Author: R Wingate Date: 5 July 1917 Location: Egypt Nationality: British Text: THE RESIDENCYRAMLEHEGYPT.HIGH COMMISSIONERFOR EGYPT.5th July 1917Dictated.My dear BirdwoodI am so much obliged to you for yourintensely interesting letter dated 20th May in which you weregood enough to enclose a copy of a letter which you had recentlywritten to the Governor General of Australia describing thefighting since your gallant Corps entered Bapaume. I doindeed congratulate you and your magnificent troops most warmlyfor their splendid courage and devotion to duty in this grandand most successful advance. You must be indeed proud tocommand such men and I hope it will not be long before youhave the Hindenburg line behind you. It pleased me immenselyto see that my old friend Smyth had done so well and I shouldbe so grateful if you would convey to him my warmest congratulationsand tell him that I should have written to him longago but am overwhelmed with work.It was as you say bad luck that the Russiansshould have collapsed just at the critical moment when theiroffensive would have been of such enormous value, but theyseem to have got on the move again and I earnestly trust the good news which has come through during the last few days willnow continue - This resumption of a successful offensive willdo more than anything else to destroy the seeds of anarchy,sedition and extreme socialism so sedulously sown by ourenemies who are utterly regardless of even the elements ofmorality.I saw the poor Sultan a short time ago - Asyou know he is still far from well, but he was immenselypleased with your kind message and evidently he has a warmaffection for you. I am afraid I misinformed you about theClass of the Nile you are to receive - I am sure that had theSultan been entirely free in the matter he would have givenyou the Grand Cordon and nothing would have pleased him morethan to do so, but unfortunately the Class of Decoration tobe awarded you for the work you performed in Egypt has to beregularised in relation to others who held similar rank andposition at that time, and it appears that the only officersto receive Grand Cordons were Murray and Wemyss, and were thatClass to be conferred on you it is thought it would createconsiderable feeling amongst the contemporary Generals hereat the time who received only Second Classes - It has therefore been decided that you are to receive a Second Class and I amextremely sorry to have misinformed you in my previous letteron this point - When the Sultan discussed it he naturally viewedthe matter rather from the standpoint of your present considerably -more exalted rank and position than that you held inEgypt - I feel sure you will fully understand and appreciatethe situation. I believe that the Decoration and Brevet arenow on their way to you.I had great pleasure in meeting Allenby whostayed with us for a day and a night last week and he israpidly getting the hang of things in this country - Fromwhat I have seen of him I feel pretty sure he will make thebest of the very difficult and complicated situation which hasarisen consequent on the two failures at Gaza and the Russianco11apse which has enabled the Turks to make an extremelystrong defensive position stretching from Gaza almost to BirSheba. There are rumours that a biggish Turkish offensiveis contemplated against Maud in the not distant future, but Igather he now feels ready to take on anything.I am very glad to hear that Butler is doing so well - will you give him all kind messages from me. Andwith very best wishes, my dear Birdwood, to yourself and yourgallant Corps for still greater successes in the near future,Yours very sincerely,RWingateGeneral Sir William Birdwood, K.C.S.I.,K.C.M.G.,C.B.,C.I.E. &c.1st ANZAC CORPS,B.

This prevents anyreinforcements coming from the flanks - or from X.Directly our fire lifts our boys hop in - scupper theHuns & scuttle off with any prisoners, badges &c. to ourown trenches. It is the back track that brings ourcasualties as the Enemy watches out from the flanksat C.D - & with a cross fire from machine guns - & Fritz ownbarrage - things are less safe than they might be - so youmay guess no one lingers on the back trip.These raids are great; they keep up our morale, & scareblue snakes out of Fritz. - keep us active, & suit our boys to a T.

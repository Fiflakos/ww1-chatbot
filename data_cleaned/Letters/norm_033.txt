Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli Peninsular TurkeyDate: 30 June 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Gaba Tepe30th June 1915Dearest Mother & all at HomeJust a brief note to letyou know that I am quite well, & hope you are the same.We are still holding this place without any troublewhatever, & waiting for the retreating Turks from theSouth & then we will mow them down with ourshrapnel & lyddite. They have made lyddite for our18 pounders now, & we stir the Turks gun pits & trenchesup with it, its just lovely. Down at Cape Helles,it is our incessant bombardment night & day & theysimply have to be shelled out of concrete trenches.The Turks are in honeycombs in the hill downthere & the British are going to blow it up.My gun fired 10 rounds at a Turks gun on Tuesdayafternoon & put it out of Action. It was a little dudas they put a few high explosive round about us, butthey can't shoot for nuts. Well, mother, dear, Ive notmuch news this time. I hope all are well. Give my loveto all & thank all kind enquirers after me. Tell themto be proud of the Australian InfantryI have got all the socks & handkerchiefs which youso kindly sent me. Well good-bye for the present withfondest love to all fromNorman

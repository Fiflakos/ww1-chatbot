Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli Peninsular TurkeyDate: 3 July 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just a line to let you know thatI received your most welcome letter to-day, also one fromdear Mab, one from Charl, also an "Australasian" from him& a "Table Talk" from Mab, & May Tilton wrote me a nicelong letter too, as well as enclosing an envelope & piece ofwriting paper, which is most welcome as writing materiel issimply a treasure here, and envelopes cannot be boughtfor . I also received your writing materiel as well & I amnow availing myself of it, altho' I cannot give you a greatdeal of news, worst luck, but what I do, is fairly good & I amglad to say that we are nice & "comfy" & are just waiting forthe word "go" & we are going to thrash the Turks off the faceof the Peninsular altogether. General Legge came into my GunPit the other day, & told us that the Artillery would be quitesufficent to shift the Turks from their present position, &all one had to do after this little performance would be,to go out with a cane & bring in those that were not killedas prisoners. Our howitzer artillery are doing magnificentwork & when the shells burst in the Turks trenches, it isjust like a miniature earthquake. I only wish we werearmed with them instead of what we already have, altho' our Guns are doing very good work & cause the Turks a lot oftrouble. The Turks are firing a lot of naval shells at usnow, & this would almost seem as if they have mountedsome guns from their unemployed Navy. The shells are about15 inches long, by about 8 inches in diameter; fortunately onecan hear them coming & it is rather amusing to see the boysall scamper off in different directions to try & dodge the"cow", & after it has lobbed or gone by, out they all comefrom their "funk holes", laughing & joking just as if itwas a huge cracker. They do very little damage, however,& some of them, in fact, most of them are too lazy or tiredto burst & merely fall with a tremendous thud.Of course, if they hit a gun pit, its "good night" Gun pit.but they do not fire consistenly & one never can tell wherethey will land. In fact, they land anywhere but atthe target aimed at, but nevertheless, we do not take anyunnecessary risks & avail ourselves of cover on allpossible occasions. Deleted by censor The fresh Australians landed down there last week & received theirbaptism of fire, & have created a favourable impression on boththe Turks & our side. The great fight is for Achi Baba, & whenthat place falls, expert opinion says it will be the beginningof the end. It is said to be very strongly fortified & the hillitself is said to be completely honeycomed out, & inside is onemass of machine guns & howitzers. I suppose people are gettinga little impatient at the Allies taking so long over it, but letthem only see the place, & at the same time remember, that theGallipoli Peninsular was considered, by military experts, to be"Impregnable". When the big advance begins, & it wont be longnow, people will then be able to see what sort of troops areengaged here, & to prove that they are not "second raters"Let them remember we are fighting a fresh enemy & havehad to gain our footing & these Turks have been months diggingthemselves in & they have made a good job of it too.The success of the Australians was due to the self courage &individual judgement, as well as the mad, frantic desire to get"into it" & stir up somebody with their bayonets. It did notmatter who it was to be, Turk, German, Austrian or anyone else, theywould have charged & taken the place just the same.Just to prove how the Australians are enjoying themselves,when there is going to be a night attack, one can't buy a placein the main firing trench, & men are known to have refused2 for their positions during the fighting. They stand up in the trenches & yell out "Come on, well give you Allah", & actuallylet the Turks get right to within 20 yards, then open up withterrific volleys & mow them down in hundreds. In some instancesthey let some Turks actually get into our Trenches & then ticklethem up with the bayonet. I've met 2 more Christ Church Choirboys here, Albert Charles Prosser, & Spencer Hoskins, so just letthe vicar know & to put them on the list at the Church door, ifthey are not already on it. Prosser ran away from home &enlisted in New South Wales Infantry (2nd Battalion) & was woundedthe first day with shrapnel in the back & the bullet is stillembedded in his back, between the spine & kidney & the Dr saysit will take some time for it to work out of the muscle & thenthey will operate on him. He sneaked back unbeknown to theAuthorities & is in the firing line again & has been through anotherbayonet charge. Hows that eh, Mum. He enlisted under thename of Albert Charles. His father is the publisher of the "Age".I am glad to know that Billy Coleman is coming away, & I willnot be surprised if George enlists as well. Let me tell them thatthere is plenty of room for them, so don't be bashful, & let thembring along a few more with them.I must say that admitting we are in a warlike country &the noise indicates anything but peace, but I must confess thatthe sunsets we see here, surpass anything of the kind inAustralian & whilst I am writing this, there is a most gloriousscene out by Imbros & all the boys are watching it. In commencing this page, I want you to understand that it is beingwritten on the next night to that of the previous pages written, as Ifind it difficult to write during the daytime, & a little more newsavailable. Early this morning, the Turks concentrated their Artillery& opened fire on our positions at daybreak, & things were lively forsome little time. A six inch shell struck our gun pit & came in& burst. There were 3 gunners sleeping inside when it burst, &of course were rudely awakened; Strange to say not one of themwas injured, altho' they suffered somewhat from shock & alittle temporary deafness, which will soon pass off. Consideringthe size of the shell, it is simply miraculous how any of the threeescaped with their lives, but wonders will never cease.All kinds of shell came over, & from all directions, & it hadus thinking which side of the trench to sit, but there is alwaysa "Wag" in the crowd who has something dead funny to say &this keeps the crowd merry. He inferred that "somebody should geta Solicitors letter" over all this shelling.Well, Mother, I think I have come to the end of this epistleso will draw to a conclusion, assuring you all that I am in thevery best of health & spirits & that we will soon drive the Turksout of the Peninsular & then we will go on to Germany & "mop"up the Kaiser.I hope you are all well & I want you not to worry about meso with the best of love to all at home, Believe me to beYour affectionate SonNorman.

March 1917My dear General.I am much touched,Nothing could have givenme greater pleasure thanyour letter which I foundon my return from I.H.Qlast night.K talked so much about youalways using your pet namethat I seem to know you well.Two days ago I was atBapaume. Next time I hope you will let mecall and see you!!I will come up from theChief's with Heseltine orsomebody.Yes. our people have beenvery mean about K,rending his great nameto suit their pettypolitical exigencies.However, he lies peacefullyat the bottom of the seas, unheeding these jackals.No one who knew theofficial K could realisethe tones of his voicewhen he spoke of a friendlike you.No one, among hiscolleagues, realised thathe had no axe togrind, and cared fornothing except to seeEngland victorious.It is right and proper that he should be made ascape goat for men whohave an eye on "honours"or their pockets.It is all in this great traditionof heroes and martyrs.I was very much attached tohim and to Fitz,and I hope, then soon Iam again with D.H.to have a talk with youagain, many thanks.Yours most sincerely,G.

We are still living like lords, and I have had nofurther trips to the side of the boat. The men arequartered in holds, now called Troop decks & arefitted up in the best of style, they sleep in Hammocks& stow them away during the day & they have largeMess Tables & enamel ware to eat from. Their mealsare of the very best kind & for breakfast, they havePorridge, Sausages & Chops & Fresh bread & jam &pickles: For Dinner, Soup, Roast Beef or Mutton,3 kinds of Vegetables & Plum or Rice pudding;For Tea, Cold Meat, biscuits & Jam, butter &milk & Cheese & Sugar and all those kind of thingsare plentiful.We Sergeants, have First Class (cabins-de lux)Cabins (3 in each) & First Class Saloon accomodation formeals & amusements & the meals are excellent & one can have as much as one likes, we get freshhot bread rolls every morning & I generally eat5 or 6.Our horses are stabled on the Deck and weexercise them every day by walking them aroundthe Deck, & they relish it so much that some ofthem don't want to go into their stalls again.Up to now, there is only one horse had to bedestroyed, owing to pneumonia, & after being cut upfor instruction, was thrown to the sharks No body is allowed to go ashore, only the heads& they have to go by means of a dirty tug boat.Braithwaite got vaccinated 2 days ago &all the boys kidded him that he looked terriblebad afterwards, so he went & saw the Dr & isnow in the Sick Bay (absolutely frightened)It was only the other day, he was laughing atme for being sea sick, but I've got the laugh now.Our men are shaping very well & very few aresick.Dowsett is still trying to run the Battery & isgiving poor Jock Adams a bad time, he is a fairrotter & would swear a mans life away, I don'ttake any notice of him & I answer him straightout & shut him up.Tell, Mab, that I don't think I would takeon a Sea trip for pleasure, it gets too monotonous &no room for running about.How is Charlie & Hellis & Children; givethem all my love.Hope George is well & business a success.I will try & write to Winchelsea next time, butwhen you write, tell them I am alright & thinking ofthem often. Will close now Mother with fondestLove to all from your SonNormanSix weeks trip toPort Said. We sailfrom here Sunday.

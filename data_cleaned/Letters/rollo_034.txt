Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Date: 23 June 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: First Stunt.who tumbled to what was up, & attackedI had my men extended over a large area - &gave orders no firing till I gave word.Turks crept up & began sniping diggers fromabout 25 yds ahead - that was queer to see[*23.6.15.*]the blue flashes a few feet in front - & tofeel the wind of bullets passing close by. TheMajor in charge of diggers told me - hewondered where wed got to - as I didntopen fire till late. Anyhow I gave signalfor "5 rounds rapid". My word there wasa scatter - & the Turks - about 100 - clearedtaking dead & wounded with them. Wefollowed up a short distance - taking positionon crest of the hill - from on which howeverwe were exploded by a machine gun.We got back to our old cover withoutloss somehow or other. - We were supposedto be out from 9.30 to 2.30 - but Majordid not withdraw diggers till 3.30 a.m. sowe had to stay till they got in. Thencame my job in half-daylight to get mymen back safely. Frontage 200 yds. & everysniper & rifle about - seemed to search this from the75 yds we had to retire - but 11th & 10th in old fire trench - opened a heavy rapid andI took advantage - rushed the men back- & got in with only two casualties - Jackson(in stom.) & Corp. Phyllis (foot) neither serious.[*June 23.*]When I got back I was roused at forstaying out too long - but Id have beencourt-mtld. if Id come in before MajorBrockmans diggers. The Junior- sub. - getsall the Kicks.This was my first independent command -but I got through O.K. - and I amlooking forward to my next stunt.Holmes died today. Ireland is in C. Co.27. 6. 15A padre passed 100 envelopes & sheets to Col Weir & Ivehad luck to get a sheet or two - so I am able towrite in style & enclose some letters for you to send on[*27. 6. 15*]Situation here unchanged - except 11th have madesecure their new trench. Jacko has got someTaubes, & promises to make things unpleasant forus, until we get them. They had the neck to dropmessages advising us to surrender - as you arebeing misled by England who is on her last legs.Also they assert they could push us into the seaat any time. I only wish they would try that game. Stan. Ireland is transferred - so he & I are together &share the same pozzie.We are getting quite luxurious now; we got friendlywith some officers on the store-ships who make us paythrough the nose for what we do get. Four of usagreed to get some pickles, sauce, oatmeal &c the other day.Cornish was the buyer. For 30/- (or 7/6 each) we got6 bottles pickles, 6 sauce, 3 Worcester, 7lb oatmeal & 1 smallpacket of cocoa. 1lb coffee, & 6 tins mixed jam. I thought thiswas rather a hot price, - but still we might as wellget the things whilst we have the chance - & the cash.Today Cornish has gone to the Hosp. Ship to fixup some of Holmes business - & also to try & get somesoap (for cleaning clothes) & some chocolate too.I only brought 6 pair sox from Egypt - left others intrunk - transport accommodation is not what it wasin the Boer War - so Im economising. Im keeping4 pair for emergencies, & wearing the other two turnabout - Getting quite an old soldiers way - eh?Anyhow 6 pairs wont last long here if we stay - (Icandidly believe well be away in 6 or 8 weeks) - so sendalong a pair each month. A pair of thick gray woolones is tip-top - stand much rough wear - & last twiceas long as others - before they stand up & talk.Of course if we go back to Egypt or to England dont send. This life is very rough on clothes but Im pretty careful& look after mine. I would not be ashamed to go on paradein my uniform at present. My boots are tip-top - asScott got them re-soled just before I left, S.A. AnUnley bootmaker did the job, & he did it well too.Those cork & asbestos soles save the inside, and hardlyshow a sign of wear.I notice there have been some more big moves inyour line. I wonder if I will ever get back to theDept. - Im afraid I will not be able to serve underthe Methodists & their parasites - Certainly the MilitaryStaff is the very quintessence of red tape - but onehas a certain amount of authority which cannot beoverstepped even by Kitchener. I mean to keep myeyes open for a Staff job - but as everyone else isafter the same I may not get one. If I can finda farmer in the S.E to take me on as a learningpartner I will look him up. Anyhow life in theDept. will be a misery - especially when competing withcold footers like Halse - & others of my year. Of coursethe more of us who volunteer - the less competition forthem - so Williams & Co are glad to see us go. W. is anonly son - no-one dependent on him - yet he remains.Dickenson, on the other hand, has his only brother here& a mother & three sisters at home. My boys 5/10 have not arrived yet, & I hear are beingvery badly treated. They went in a body to Camp H.Qin Cairo, & asked to be allowed to join their officers.This was taken as a breach of discipline - but I canimagine what the poor beggars must feel: beingdrilled by incompetent English & Ceylon officers -with no-one to take the least interest in them.I spoke to the Colonel about them - but he cando nothing - Brigade H.Q. say they will be broughtup in time to reinforce us when we advance. Wecould do with them here even now, - they are welltrained Spens' inspection & remarks proved that,and as for disc. & conduct - when they werewith me - one could wish for none better.I reckon one could go right through the BritishArmy an equally disciplined & better conducted setof men.I heard Tom Abbott is crippled with fever at Helio.- he was Mid Wt. Boxing Champion on his troop-ship.Jack Gordon is likely to be 2/Lt. in machine gun co.,Have been nearly a month here & only 10 weeks sinceI left Australia Munro wrote to me on Ap 7. & it hasfollowed me on from Morphetville. Are any moreHoughton mates volunteering? Things look bad inEngland - air raids &c - Any letters lately?

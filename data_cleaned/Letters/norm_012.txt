We heard the most glorious newsto-day that we will be at the Front in 3 months time.I can't tell you what a joy I felt on receiving thisglorious news. I can tell you, Mother, all our boyswill give a good account of themselves, as their workis beautiful & their Gun Drill & Laying, splendid &we are simply itching to be right in the thick ofthe Fight. Since we have been in Camp here, wehave been told that all our Drill has been altered& today, we started on the new stuff. It is like this,A battery is ordered into Position, & this is done atthe dead of night & as soon as we get there, we haveto dig the Guns & Wagons into the ground & entirelyconcealed from the enemy. The ground is bankedup 4 feet high all around the guns & trenches for thegunners are dug 6 feet deep on each side like this- ground 2 feet 6 inches widebig enough for men tolie down in hereSo you see we are quite safe, & thismethod was discovered in this war & ofcourse, the War Office is circulating theseparticulars to all our troops. We remain in these places for days & even weeks &during the night, the wagons come up & keep us wellsupplied with ammunition. In most cases the gunsare so well covered, that grass & other quick growingstuff is sown on top & it is impossible to detect anythingat 500 yards. The Artillerymen are thus splendidlyprotected & thoroughly enjoyed theirselves. Even theOfficers are dug in & telephones are used to eachgun pit. Signalling is entirely done away with.Sir George Reid visited us yesterday & weturned out in full force to greet him & he made along speech to us & we were afterwards presentedwith a pocket knife each & we also got a Tin ofChocolate which I will send home to you. I amsending some Post Cards by this mail & hope youreceive them. There is not much to tell you aboutas I have written to you every week lately. I got aletter from Alice Cutler to-day dated 1st November & thiswas the date we sailed from Albany, so you seethey don't bustle with the Mail here.Well Mother dear, I'll now close wishingall the Compliments of the Season & the best loveto all at home & elsewhere, & an extra ration toyourself.

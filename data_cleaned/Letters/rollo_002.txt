Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Nationality: Australian Text: We are all in tip-top condition - and this week themen are to be put through a course 'on the ranges'. I expectgreat things from my boys, so we are all anxiously lookingforward to "Some" shooting. Rapid aiming & loadingis my 'Fad' at present - my chaps must curse me attimes for I make their thumbs & wrists ache - but thetime is coming when they will appreciate the arduous& monotonous work here.In my spare time I'm going to learn more aboutmachine gunnery - but I am watching a certain chancefor promotion - but as M.G. wont do me as far asprom. is concerned I wont trouble much about it.Re India - I recd. a reply that at present I am tooold for a Commission, but after the war there maybe opportunities. Mind I don't intend to go on my kneesto get in the Br. or Indian armies - I'd rather goto Hell than serve under or with some of the English puppymongrels who have got coms. since war began - someof the new type are a disgrace to the British annals. Ifsome of the fellows I have seen are fair specimens of theEnglish - well thank God - I'm an Australian.The British Army contains many good ones - but there areothers who lack initiative, endurance & resource, & God helpEngland if she relies on these last. I guess the bonesof the old '/82. heroes felt like coming to attention as wemarched past. This is a weird letter - but this war hasmade me intensely British & absolutely Australian. Much love etc. Rollo

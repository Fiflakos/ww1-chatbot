Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: France away from SommeDate: 8 September 1916 Nationality: Australian Text:We have now left the Somme Area and are on our way to theYpres Salient. and we are Reserve now. We will have aboutfive weeks rest here, in order to re-train & re-organise & generallyto do all we can to make ourselves as Hydras.I will give you a short description of our stunt of 1st weekin Sept., & forward a rough diagram to show positions.In our previous stunt (12, 13, 14) Aug. myCompany took & consolidated the line E.F.and tried to dig the line A.B. but hadto retire through lack of support to E.F.This time the whole Brigade were put at Mouquet & 9th hadto take C.D. 50th in support of Park Lane E.F. 51st had toattack AB., & 52nd B.C.We reached Park Lane on the night of the 2nd & took the chanceof re-digging & deepening the line - in some places 9 deep soas to be safe from the hate of Fritz when the stunt opened.At dawn on the 3rd the attack started - each battalion wassuccessful in reaching its objective - though all had a veryrough passage. Almost at once I had to send a platoon witha couple of Lewis guns to point B - & here my boys did good work.In fact C.O. Of 5 has recommended Cheney who took up theparty for honor. About 9 a.m. the 52nd fell back on our line E.F.

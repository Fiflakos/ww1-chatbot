I left for homeon the 14th and your letter was wrote on the 11th.I can quite understand how, I never received it. When Igave the reported, the particulars about your BrothersI was at that time stationed at Randwick Hospital,but a few days after, I left and was staying at myfriends place at Lindfield. I seen a good lot of yourBrothers from the time I meet them, and was not morethan five yards off when the shell caught us. Your twopoor Brothers were between my Brother & I.When the shell had exploded I knew by the screamsthat someone had caught it. I could not get throughfor sometime , as I was half silly through the shock.However when I could get through, my Brother wasseriously wounded and your to Brothers were layingthere, they had been shifted, because when I wasreturning to the front line again I could not see themMy Brother is having a rough time he is still in hospital , he cannot Walk but gets about oncrutches, as best he can. I expect he will be homein a few months time. I am pretty well againmy hand is not much good to me at present,but I have hopes that in time it will comealright. I will more then likely be in SydneyWednesday or Thursday, and if I am, with yourKind permission I will come and see you.I hope you can understand this scribble.I RemainYours SincerelyWill Hale

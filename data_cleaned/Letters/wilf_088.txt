Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 24 April 1917 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Racecourse Cairo Egypt Nationality: Australian Text: 24.4.1917My dear mother,Much has happened since I last wroteyou & we have had rather a strenuous time. It is nowabout nine days since we left our last bivouac & sincethen we have been constantly moving & living in theopen. We have settled down again now though I cantsay we are very comfy, as we have very little stuffwith us for shelters & it is very windy & exceedingly dusty& very hot. Flies have come along again & are makinga nuisance of themselves. We left our old campnear the sea the day after I last wrote & moved outtowards the Turks but not very much fighting tookplace on the first day or two, on our part of the linethough I believe there was a good deal on ourleft. On the third day however the main attackwas made & it was an exceedingly fierce scrap.I was placed in charge of the dressingstation for the whole of our division abouttwo miles back from the main firing line & asI did not go up with the sandcarts I wasexposed to comparatively little risk. Weput up a couple of tents & a Red Cross flag collected some wood from an old house nearby, had a fire made & some hot tea& cocoa ready. We then laid out ourdressings & instruments & were ready. Aftermaking tea for ourselves & having somebreakfast the wounded commenced to rollin & we were kept busy. They were brought backin sandcarts & then put in our tents, dressed& given hot drinks & Morphia if necessary& then sent on by more sandcarts, motorAmbulances & the sitting cases on horselimbers & anything which came along.Later on in the day they came in so fast thatwe could hardly cope with them. as I was theonly medico there & had only abouthalf a dozen assistants but we workedon as hard as we could. Then we had difficultyin getting enough transport to take them backfurther & accumulated numbers in our stationHowever by dint of requisitioning everythingwhich came along the road weeventually cleared by 9.30 p.m. & cameaway ourselves. Some officers I know well & am very fond of were hit & I hated tosee them there - I never seem to hate war somuch as when I see fine fellows getting bowledover. The gun fire was particularly heavy thatday, shrapnel & high explosive were burstingall day long. The Turks had one big gun whichwas firing constantly & seeking for one ofour batteries & it was one succession of hugeexplosions when these shells crashed on thehollow near these batteries. It looked as ifthey were going to shell us once but they didn'tas I fancy they sighted the flag -each shellcame closer along the track until theywere within about 100 yards & then theystopped. I think in the front line of thefighting it was one of the most furiousdays we have had as the rifle & machinegun fire was intense & the shelling verysevere. Of the numbers of our casualties Icannot speak but as the whole of ourdivision was passing through my handsI can say without divulging anything thatI have never had to deal with so many beforeThe Turks also must have suffered very heavily.I brought the last of our wounded backto the next station & then back to the next& returned again to xxx a spot where Ihad to meet the rest of the Ambulancearriving there early in the morning. I movedout again early next morning with theBrigade & we were expecting an attack fromthe Turks that night or early nextmorning but none came & I was notvery sorry as we were all very tired. We wererelieved next evening & came back a mile ortwo to camp & thence back to this spotwhich is a vile place. All the earthsoon cuts up to a fine floury powderwhich blows everywhere & when we takeour horses to water 3 miles awaywe travel the whole time in a cloud ofthis beastly stuff. Some Turkish prisonersI saw this time were a very well fed & clothedlot - I fancy the tales we hear of Turkeystarving are rather imaginary.Matters appear to be progressing well inFrance & I sincerely hope they continueto do so, as I want the beastly oldwar to end up as quickly as possible.All these Bedouin huts are as full as fullcan be of fleas & the Colonel incautiouslyentered one to look round one day & therehe looked down at his foot & saw notone flea but his foot covered with hundredsof fleas. Another officer caught some tooin the same way & they picked & pickedthem off & still they came & of course wegot them too & every night during the operationthey worried us as we had no change of clothes& couldn't wash them. However Im changed& clean again now or as clean as thedust will allow me to be. You would havelaughed though to see us hunting for these fleas& cursing volubly at the wretches whenthey spoilt our rest when we were dog tired.No more news this time my dear hope it willbe better next & we are a bit moresettled with love to all & a double shareto mother fromYour loving sonWilf.

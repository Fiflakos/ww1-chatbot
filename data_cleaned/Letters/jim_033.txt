Author: James Joseph Makin Location: France Date: 7 May 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France, 7/5/1916. Dear Mother & Father, There is another mail out tomorrow so I am sending you a little more news. There has been nothing startling during the past weeks- just training , route- marches, three meals each day, and room in a tent at night. I have notheard from Les since. I got a letter from Harry yesterday dated 20/3/16 but have nothing from home since 11/2/16. There is a large mail in at present so I should get some letters in a day or so. I would have liked to be able to tell you I had your letters. It would have been easier to write this is I had something to answer, but I shall do my best under the circumstances. Did the Ballarat people find you alright? I should have liked to have seen them. It is three years last Easter since I was up at Ballarat with them is it not? Those few days such of cold and wet have only been beaten by the weather we had here for a fortnight or so. It has been lovely spring weather here lately, and the route marches have been a pleasure to me. Each time we go for a march the indications of the arrival of spring are more noticeable. The trees are now in leaf and everything is fresh and green. The crops have grown so that the hares are harder to see as they steal away. This part of France beats Victoria (or the parts I have seen of it) for wild flowers. They grow along the roadways and lanes in profusion, The sky larks are here just as they were at St Albans, only ever so many more. They are singing at all times- even at the peep of dawn, which is not long after 3 o'clock these mornings. Some days have been quite hot, and many of us are wearing "shorts". The English papers are full of the doings of our "Billy" Hughes and his fellow compatriot Lloyd George. They had a great day at Conway in Wales yesterday, and made characteristic speeches. After reading their speeches I was able to say " Them's my sentiments" Both of these fiery little Welshmen advocate a more vigorous campaign and a plea for putting out whole strength in the field. I feel that the sooner this is done, the sooner the Hun will go under and the sooner we will get home. I shall not be sorry when we make a move out of this camp to try our luck against the "Germhuns." I see from Harry's letter that Jack Scanlon got home alright and that his arm is nearly better. Have any more Middle Park boys become soldiers since I left? I am stuck for news so I shall have to finish off this hopeless scrawl with a promise to write a better one next week. Your affectionate son, Jim.

Text: Dear Jim (Mr Porter) Just a few lines to let you know things are going. Am having a fairly good time nothing at all to grumble about. I dont think I shall be going to France for a few months yet. I met one of the chaps from the tickets department last week he is in the R.F.C. down here. Some of us were feet under canvas for a fortnight but owing to the wind and rain we were moved back to the huts. When we were under canvas, we used not get up till 8 oclock, we were supposed to go on parade at 6.15am, but we dodged that. I enclose photo (not dressed for the occasion) outside our hut L20 or Hell 20 as it has been called. I am looking forward to seeing some of the office chaps when I am able to get leave. I hope your brother is getting on alright in France. Hoping you are in the pink like myself, Yours very sincerely F. Turner. Please write as soon as poss.

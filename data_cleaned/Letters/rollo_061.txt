Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: Anzac Cove EgyptDate: 10 November 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Your letter end of Sept & found this morningalso from Bema, Dr Schulz & George. Parcel fromBema very acceptable indeed - especially fine cap -comforter, mittens, & flynet - latter not needednow - as flies have disappeared.Things go just the same, - a half heartedattack on some L.H. trenches about half a mileto our right - providing a little variation. Oneof my platoon was shot in the eye, and oneof my own men (Ashcroft) got a lump of stonein his forehead from a richochet. It aboutknocked him out - but he just had his headbandaged & then carried on as usual.Two or three others of my chaps have beenwounded - & stuck it out. Philps, Ween, & Bland,K.O.K. is due here in a few days, & Iwonder what he will think of the "glorious muddle"this business has been converted into.He's got 'his' army to thank for it, not ours.Our relief is still held back - (submarinescares &c.) - but its solid the way they aretreating us the 3rd Brigade & the L.H. We wentthrough the strain of the initial occupations,& have held on against most rigorous attacks. Bema mentioned rumors about us beingbound for England, but its not too much Englandwe'll see. Only senior officers & extreme cases arebeing sent there - others to Egypt - or severecases (conval) to AustraliaJust 24 weeks I've been here and am lookingforward to a good spell - but if we are pulledout wed be back again in a month or so.Brig. Gen. Maclagan is on his way back here -so we may soon find out we are not the'Cinderellas' as we've been called since Sept.Our latest recreation is sniping at M.G. positionsrather futile and risky - but still when 8 or 9rifles plump shots into or about a M.G. fromvarious places - the enemy think it is time todismount M.G. & imshi In this way we stop alot of harassing us - Beachy Bill battery isstill effective - also a very mobile 7.5 mm Batteryon Gun Ridge which gives us a warm time - butrarely puts anyone out. This battery was gotby the Bulgarians from France in 1909 - & wastaken by the Turks. Jacko also has a batteryof 18 pdrs which were made for New Zealandbut N.Z. altered their plans, & England sold the -lot to Jacko - so now they're against us here andat Helles too. Jacko has a very mixed lot - 75s, 9.12., 18 pdrs.3.7, 4.2, 8.2, & 11.2 but much of the 8.2 stuff isdud stuff. Dr Nott has a photo of seven whichlanded within space 5 yds. square - & didn't 'bust.'During the Save Bahr action we (10th) got wellover 60 of these 'duds' - & we hope they keep up thesame class of ammunition or we'd get fits.The 11.2 blew the top off one or two hills in oursector - but the navy is supposed to have putit out of action. As 11.2 are only on the 'Greben'I guess they've moved back into Sea of MarmaraThe R.N. cut up the W.A. L. Horse & certainly blewthe Ghurkas off 971 - & as we see no battleshipsnow our opinion of the R.N. is going south.Lizzie P.W. or Bacchaute were & are O.K. -& so were 'Majestic' & 'Triumph' - but the Admiraltymessed up this job properly in Feb. & March.We get whips of good news from Russia,France & Servia - but I guess most of it is "hotair". I had the job of showing some Pommie"officials" round our lines - & it made me sick to hearthe patronising Stra-ordinary! What! These ballyAustralians are ingenious beggars arent they That!I lost my temper at last & rapped out - Myblinking oath - & what's more what we ____ ___ getwe ___ ___ stick to too". No more was said by thesechaps - they'd lost 971 - they processed the restof the way like "Chokoes'. Good luck best wishes,Rollo

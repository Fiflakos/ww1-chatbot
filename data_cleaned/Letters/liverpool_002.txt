Author: Lord Liverpool Recipient: Lord William Birdwood Date: 22 February 1916 Nationality: New Zealand Text:Dear General,Thanks very much for your letter of the 13thDecember, which I have just received.We have despatched the two Hospital Ships once more ontheir journey and I understand that the "Marama" took a largeconsignment of wounded to England, and has now left Englandon the 15th February for the purpose of doing further dutyin the Mediterranean.The "Maheno" will be arriving in a few days at Suez andI understand that they are sending her back to New Zealandwith a full compliment of wounded from Egypt, together withsome invalids from England, which the "Marama" is droppingfor her.I was very grateful for all your notes in respect to the"Maheno" and as far as possible I have had all your suggestionscarried out. It has been a little difficult to make thealterations as regards the officers' quarters. I am wellaware that sick officers do like to have privacy, but owingto lack of space, it has been impossible for me to have separatecabins constructed, otherwise it would have lessened the amountof accommodation which the ship could carry. I am sure you willappreciate my desire to meet your wishes in every respect, butI think you will agree with me that it was best not to constructseparate cabins at the expense of the general accommodation. Ishall always be grateful if you will inform me on any pointregarding alterations to the Hospital Ships which you may thinkdesirable.As there was no very severe fighting taking place justafter your evacuation of Anzac, I suggested to Lord Kitchenerthat if he thought it desirable, and if of any service to him,we should be delighted if one of the Hospital Ships was sent tothe Persian Gulf as I understood that the accommodation forthe wounded in that sphere of operations was not perhaps asgood as in others. However he replied that he did not thinkthat the ship could be usefully employed in the Persian Gulf.as only shallow draft steamers could be used. I am sorry thatthis has not been possible because I hear that our woundedsuffered considerably after the Battle of Ctesphion, and inthe case of my own brother, he was from November 22nd toDecember 5th before he got into a hospital, and I know thatthe casualties were very heavy.I have been in correspondence with Lord Hardinge and weare now arranging to send a consignment of Red Cross goodsfrom here for the troops in Mesopotamia.I am glad that we have been able to acquiese in your wishesto form a complete New Zealand Division. It has been madepossible from the fact that you have not asked us to increaseour quota of reinforcements. One has so many things to consider herein finding reinforcements, that I think we have arrived atpractically the limit of our power of increase. When I say this,I wish you to remember the fact that one cannot indefinitelydenude the industries of the Dominion, because the Secretaryof State for the Colonies has impressed on us the necessity ofkeeping up our full supply of wool and meat for the feeding ofthe various Armies in the field. There is always a section ofthe population who desire to do a little bit more than it wouldbe feasible to do, and they of course are not aware of thesecret communications which have passed between Mr Harcourt,Mr Bonar Law, and myself, on this subject, and I feel certainthat you will agree that a certain number of men which we havepledged ourselves to send every four weeks, as reinforcements,is a far more valuable asset to the Empire generally, than adoubtful increase of this number, and which might possiblyhinder the various industries to which I have referred. Althoughperhaps I ought not to say so, I think that the men who arebeing sent now are quite as good as any who have gone beforethem, and further, I gather, although I would not say it toanyone else but you, that their discipline, training andbehavior, are greatly in advance of our Australian brothers.So far as the new Regiment of the New Zealand Rifle Brigadeis concerned, I think that the 4th Battalion which has latelysailed from Auckland was the best Battalion I have seen, it iscurious that such should be the case as I passed nearly thewhole of my service in our own 4th Battalion. I am surewhoever you appoint in command of the Brigade will be worthyof that appointment. Braithwaite is an old friend of mineand I went to Sandhurst at the same time, so for many reasonsI should be glad to see him in command, although he is not aRifleman by birth.You are well aware that the troops, when they get to Egyptnow, are being provided with rifles supplied from Home, and Ihave just suggested to the Imperial Authorities that if possiblethese arms should be sent to New Zealand so that the troopscould be actually trained with them, because you well understand how valuable it is for a man to shoot, during his training,with his own rifle. I do not know whether this will bepossible to do.In conclusion I desire to reciprocate your good wishesfor 1916. Believe me,Yours sincerely,Liverpool GOVERNMENT HOUSE DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND Government HouseWELLINGTON [*Private & Personal*]

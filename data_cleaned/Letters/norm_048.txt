Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: No 18 Stationary HospitalDate: 30 October 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: No 18 Stationary Hospital October 30th 1915Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just a line to let youknow that altho' I am still inHospital, nevertheless I am doingfamously & feeling great, & am verypleased to tell you that the Drhas put my name down for atrip to either England or elsewhere.He wants to try & get me toEngland, but I believe Australians& New Zealanders have somedifficulty in getting past Alexandriaowing to some rivalry betweenthe Australian Authorities & theImperial Authorities, & this maypossibly block me from a nice littletrip to the old Country, neverthelessthe Dr Is doing his best for meto get to England, and both he &the nurse have been telling meof the different places of interestthat I should see, & what bus totake & all that sort of thing, soyou see they are awfully niceto me. The Dr (Scott) is a youngAmerican & has the real Yankee drawl, & when he comes into ourward of a morning, he looks atme & says "Waal Sargeant, Ididn't see ye in Piccadilly Circusthis marning" & things likethat, so I'm a moral for atrip somewhere. He has justfelt my pulse & said "Yaasyou're alright for Leister Squarre"Sister Fletcher, in charge ofour Ward, I cannot speak toohighly of; Her efforts & energyare wonderful & untiring. Sheis, of course, an English girl,as all the nurses & orderliesare; the latter are all menof course & do all the dirtywork. Most of the patientsare Tommies & don't seem tomind how much work theyput the nurse & orderlies to.The nurse told me that shewould rather nurse 10 ofthe Australians or New Zealanders,than 5 tommies as wedon't give nearly the trouble. The Dr has just come & told methat the big "Mauretania isexpected in in a day or two, &that she was there at Alexandriapicking up some patientsthere & was then coming here& after filling up here, wouldgo direct to England, so mychances look rosy.I am on soft diet such asBoiled Eggs, Arrowroot, BoiledChicken, & Bread, butter & honey& tea & milk, sodawater, etc.& a bottle of stout everyday,but I have signed the pledgeagain & usually give my stoutto our Orderly, who is a splendidchap & can't do enough forme. I will be able to drawsome money when I get toEngland, but the Dr told methat we get motor trips & bussrides, & admission to thetheatres & music halls for "nix"& others at price. I must goout to Gravesend to see yourpeople & I also want to attenda service in St Pauls Cathedral,London if possible & the Dr toldme to be sure to visit WestminsterAbbey & to see theCrown Jewels & all that sort ofthing. He even told me to besure & get on bus number 88at Nelsons Monument & for 2'you can travel along the mostinteresting route in London, & toldme of all the places I wouldsee, such as the War Office,Horse Guards, Hyde Park & allthose kinds of places, so if theZeppelins are good enoughto keep out whilst Im there,I should have a good time.I have also just heardsome cheering news that theGermans have threatened to torpoedo the Mauretania,but I don't mind so long asI get on board of her, I'llchance all the Submarines.They have been fairly activearound here lately & giveour Torpoedo boat destroyersplenty of work escortingtroopships & storeships intothis harbour. It is veryinteresting to watch these littleboats escorting a battleshipor transport about. They goat a tremendous speed &cut across the front of theother boats bows & twist &turn & then fly around herstern, then off up past herher at a tremendous pace& dodge about all over theplace. Of course the guncrews are always at theirguns & men on the lookout for any sign of aperiscope. The chaps incommand of these destroyersare most youthful & veryyoung in appearance, onechap I saw was the livingimage of our poor Alt &I could not take my eyesoff him. He was Altsdouble in everyway inappearance. The midshipmenon the big battleships too, areonly youngsters just out ofcollege, & some of them arenot more that 13 & 14 yearsof age, but they are wonderfullyplucky, they were incharge of the pinnaces thattowed us ashore on thememorable 25th of April &altho' shrapnel was flyingabout in all directions,they went on with their worklike seasoned veterans.The Navy are having a goodtime in this harbour, they putnets around the sides of theship & there are the Officersin white clothes playing cricket& tennis & other games, & theband playing to them. Theydon't steam out unless thereis any big "stunt" on up atthe Peninsular & then theydon't stay for long onaccount of the Submarines.Things have been bungledfrom the start over there, butwe hope great things fromSir Ian Hamiltons successor.General Munro or somethinghis name is, but it is a thankless job taking a jobwhere a another man has beennot so successful as wasexpected of him. However,lets hope it will all be oversoon & peace declared.You will be sorry to hear ofmy dear little pal, Les Ilsleywho was my 2nd Trumpeter inthe old Windsor battery, & wentto New Zealand to do Insuranceoffice work, he joined the N.Zmounted forces & came overhere, but has been killed inAction in the charge of August 6-7I am terribly grieved & only learntof it here whilst reading aNew Zealand newspaper.Well Mother dear, don't worryabout me, Enteric is not so bad afterall, & Im quite alright. Give mylove to all at Home & elsewhere& accept a double whack foryour dear self from yourloving son, Norman.

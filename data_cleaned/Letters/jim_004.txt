Author: James Joseph Makin Location: No 1 Command Depot Perham Down HampDate: 7 November 1916Nationality: Australian Text: Dearest Mother & Father, The mail is about to close, so I am writing at the latest moment to give you the "absolute latest". Things are just the same here. Still on "light duty" and no sign of shifting. Les was well when last I heard. Thecasualties have not been so heavy lately. I had arranged to go over to Larkhill last Sunday to see Harry Makin and Norman Spence, but the weather wastoo bad. Cold winds, torrents of rain, a little snow, and mud galore - and you have Salisbury Plains described. The 9th Brigade, in which Harry Makin is, is still here in England. I may be in London when next you hear of me. I am taking ajob in the Pay Office temporarily. Have just refused five days leave. Saving money for Xmas in case I am here. I would like to go up to Scotland for Xmas. Well, dear people you must excuse thisshort note as I have no more time just now. Best love to all from Your affectionate son,Jim.

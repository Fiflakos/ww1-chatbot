Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli PeninsularDate: 24 May 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Dearest Mother & all at Home,I have just received anotherbatch of letter & papers from you & others in Melb, butthe parcel which Mab wrote about is not to hand yet,but I expect it is here & somewhere. I am glad youenjoyed your holiday at Creswick as the change willhave done you good. It must be a great blessing thatthe rain came when it did. We have the mostdelightful weather here & have had only 2 wet dayssince we landed exactly a month ago. Yesterdaywas a holiday. The Turks put up the White Flag &came in from Gaba Tepe & wanted an Armistice of24 hours to bury their dead & attend to their wounded.Our people granted them 8 hours & during this timethey buried 2,000 odd. Our fellows all went downfor a swim & the beach resembled Hampton ona holiday. The day before yesterday was a littleexciting for the men on the H.M.S. Albion. Allthe Men of War have to keep moving now as thereis an hostile submarine kicking around, & she gotto near & went aground. The Turks opened fire onher & she had to fight for her life & poured hundredsof broad sides into the Turks & as she thus lightenedherself & a rope was passed to her from the Vengeance,she towed off after being aground for 4 hours. Thingsare very quiet here now & we only have to hold our Hope Chas has got work. Tell George to write soonground until the British Division advance, & we areonly allowed to fire very little as our Infantry & theirmachine guns can hold the Turks easily. We havehad only one casualty since I last wrote to you, sothis goes to show you how slow things are. The Turksshrapnel is a little annoying at times, but as youcan hear it coming, one can generally get under cover.A German Aeroplane came over us & dropped acouple of bombs yesterday & killed one of theInfantry chaps. We get plenty of food & clothes & agood variety too, Cigarettes & Tobacco are issued tous once a week (2 packets & 1 tin of tobacco each) & Rum isalso allotted, but this doesn't interest me. My gun isnot repaired yet, but it will not be long away asthey are repairing it on the "Prince of Wales". Our gunsdid good work the other night when the Turks madea night attack which was repulsed with heavy lossWe shelled them vigorously for an hour & the Colonelcongratulated our Major on the good work.General Bridges died of his wounds & is buried atAlexandria I believe.I received a letter from May Tilton, Mab, Nell Wheeler,Paper from Creswick, 2 "Ages", & one from Mother, also one fromRuby Davidson. I have no time or materiel to write tothem, so would be obliged if you could acknowledgetheir kindness. I am in the best of health & thoroughlyenjoying the experience & hope to be in Constantinoplesoon. Hope all are well at home. Kindest love toeverybody & an extra whack for yourself I remainYour loving sonNorman.

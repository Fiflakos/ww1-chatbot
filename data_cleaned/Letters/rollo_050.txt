Author: Harold Edwin Salisbury Location: ANZAC COVE EgyptDate: 30 September 1915 Nationality: Australian Text:Dont put any extracts of mine in paper unlessyou omit all names - (my own especially) - andalso all names of units concerned. I was showna S.E. Times with an article Enlist - in it bya S.A. officer & of course only Stan Ireland ormyself are the only ones concerned. It was notmy article - so Stan must bear the blame -He was the very last type of man to have causeto write such a letter - for he left here 2months ago, with practically nothing wrong withhim. I am sorry to say he was about indisgrace to a certain extent - for twice he wasfound asleep in his watch, - many of us thinkhe got such a stirring up from Col. S.W., thathe had to get away. He also had nothing tohis credit with the 4th Rein. &as Shaw alsohad something to say about his slackness -S.I.s name is now MUD in this Battn.It is officially known he was in Hosp. 2 days1 to go in - & 2nd to go out. - since then he hasbeen holidaying in Egypt. As S.I. says therewill be some tales to tell after - but they wontbe much to his credit - or of others of his kidney.He has had the cheek to put such in the Timestoo as tho he was a sufferer!! I have writtento Mowbray to state I had no connection with hisarticle. Dont think Im grumpy - but one feels abit touchy when only 17 out of 36 officers arewith us - many of the about 19 are my seniorsand our promotion is blocked whilst they arejaying about in Cairo tc.Ive been here 4 calendar months now - andam feeling very fit still - tho I dont thinkI could do a fast 200 yds. without being blown.I am known as the barbed wire expert - butI dont take any more risks than my men do -My description of Lone Pine & 971 must waitnow - I was switched off, by being asked ifI was the author of that article - & Ive hadto blow off steam a bit. I will try & finishthe description next week. Love tc tc.Rollo

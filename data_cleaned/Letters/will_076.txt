Author: Walter H Long Date: 27 March 1917 Nationality: British Text: PRIVATE.27th March, 1917.My dear General,Thank you so much for your letter. It is allmost interesting. By this time of course you have madea much greater advance and are far beyond where I leftyour troops. I am glad to hear that your men are insuch good spirits and that they have once again provedthemselves indomitable, and I hope with all my heartthat greater triumphs may await them in the near future.I am being pressed about the inability toinflict the death sentence. I have been in communicationw1th the Australian Government but they decline totake action, and I don't think it is possible to pressMr. Hughes on this subject at a moment when he isengaged in a desperate political struggle. I amvery sorry to hear that difficulties exist in connectionwith this matter, and can only assure you thatI have done what I can and am afraid it is impossibleto do more.Thank you so much for your kindly invitation tocome and stay with you again, which I shall be veryglad to do if I have the opportunity, but I dont seemuch prospect of it as it is almost impossible toget away even for a day.Sincerely Yours,Walter H Long

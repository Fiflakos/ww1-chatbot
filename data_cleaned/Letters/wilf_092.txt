Author: Wilfred Evans Date: 24 June 1917 Regiment: 9th Light Horse Location: Palestine Nationality: Australian Text: 24.6.1917.My dear mother,I have now returned to my abode inPalestine & left the gay city behind and it may surpriseyou to learn that I travelled back in a novel way,to wit, by aeroplane. I chanced to meet a pilotin the Flying Corps whom I knew, & he hadbrought a machine to Cairo & was returningwith another on the very day that my leavewas up, & having the vacant "observers" seathe offered to take me & of course I riskedthe opportunity as I had been anxious forsome time past to have a fly & in additionit would save so much time & dreary traintravelling. We left in the morning from theCairo aerodrome about 11 a.m. The pilottook his seat behind & then I clamberedcautiously into the observer's seat in frontas it is very easy to damage the frailwings. The mechanics started the enginesby turning round the propeller which issituated in front & as soon as it wasin motion it was impossible to hearanything else as it makes an awful row. We were muffled up in flying caps whichextend over the ears & head & wore overcoatsas it is very cool when one is up somethousands of feet, although scorchinghot on the ground. The mechanicsafter the engines started removed theblocks which are placed under the wheelsof the aeroplane. which when resting on the groundto prevent them moving,& the pilot set her in motion & she glidedover the ground on her wheels graduallygaining speed until she seemed to berushing along at breakneck pace& then he lifted her off the earth &up we rose into the air. We graduallyrose until we were some hundreds offeet up & I wondered for a momentif I should feel seasick but thefeeling passed away & I felt quitecomfortable. We watched the housesgrowing smaller as we climbed& the people who became like so many pigmies & then we turned away & leftthem all behind. We still rose &eventually reached 7000 feet abovethe earth when it became quite cold.When travelling along at that heightin a straight direction, one feels quitestationary in the air although the speedis great as the earth does not appearto be moving & it is impossible to fixon any object to judge of one's speed.The sensation when turning howeveris quite weird, somewhat likea ships motion & the earth isseen at all angles as the machineslopes at angles which to the beginnerare terrifying. I could pick upthe railway line, canals, housestrees, trains, cultivation etc aswe passed on to the canal &was thoroughly enjoying myself & eventually the canal itself & thebitter lakes hove in sight. Ismalialooked awfully pretty as there thecanal broadens out into lakes &we could see boats resting snuglyon the water, & the houses nestlingamong the trees, the whole makinga very pretty sight. We had a noteto drop for Colonel Arnott at Moasca(where Jack will be going) so wegradually descended there makingall kinds of turns & circles untilwe were quite low down & there wesaw a large parade in progress &dropped our note right into italmost at Colonel Arnott's feet - itwas to tell him that his son inFrance had gained the cross deguerre. I wondered if by chanceJack had arrived & was in thatvery parade but I had heard no word. After this we rose rapidlyagain & pushed on but shortlydescended to earth to partakeof lunch with some friends ofmy pilot. We had a rest for anhour or two & then rose from earthagain & flew away across thedesert towards this part. We couldsee the railway & trains going &coming, & see the various spotswhere we have camped during thecampaign as we have pushed theenemy gradually back over the Sinai& it was very interesting to travelso rapidly & easily over the veryparts where we had toiled so laboriouslyover soft sand dunes in the blazing sun.I was by this time quite accustomedto the motion & taking an activeinterest in everything as we passed.I could pick out the very tent in thecamp where I stayed a few daysago with Max Yuille. When almostto our journeys end we sighted threeenemy aeroplanes high up in the air& our own anti aircraft guns blazing away at them& as we were between the guns & theenemy the shells passed us & causedcurrents of air which shook themachine. Of course we didn't golooking for the Germans but madefor our aerodrome where we safelyalighted & I settled down to waitfor my horses to turn up, & eventuallystayed the night & came out nextmorning. It was one of the mostglorious trips I have ever had &the 250 miles from Cairo tookonly a little over three hours to travel,whereas by train it would have takenabout 24 hours & wretchedly uncomfortableones at that. In the machine it isimpossible for the observer to speakwith the pilot save by a littletelephone they have, but they usuallywrite notes & pass them back asthe observer has quite a neat littleplace to write or draw on as thatis his chief duty. I took a fewphotos & hope they turn out well.I enjoyed my stay in Cairo very muchthough there is really very littleamusement there, but the realbenefit lies in the change of food,clean comfortable beds, goodbaths, & above all the mental change,meeting some one with different viewswho has seen something different fromthe unending monotony of the life here. I feel greatly benefited & quitesatisfied to return to my work.I saw some of our wounded fellows inhospital & a good number of nurses &in connection with the latter stuck tothe old rule that there is safety innumbers & trouble is thus avoided.to Am looking forward to a mailsoon but they tell us that allmails now will go round viaEngland & none direct so theywill take a terrible time & will standa very good chance of being sunken route which is very wretchedindeed. Goodbye my dear & verybest love to all with your ownusual & extra share fromYour loving sonWilf.

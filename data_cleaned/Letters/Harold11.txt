Text: In case its only a runor of mails being held yr. am going to write as usual - but especially so today, as this afternoon your letter Pet 6th came to hand, I was exceedingly surprised to hear you'd had nothing from me since Dec 23- it was very disappointing to hear that for I had sent a letter & parcel from Cairo on Jantor - brstheday present for mum - & about a week later another parael bende the regular letter & lmas wishes. If notcome mind Stelegraph at once to me & Ill stir things up. Wumps also wrote - practically an ultimation becouse I had not written to her - well with shofting about training - lecturing, working all day long, t one does not feel up to writing. Iit has been an effort to even write to you - for really were no news to send Uncle Will also wrote mentioning that he expected should be a capt. now the army has been increased. but we have already seen cold footed seniors father the pluns- because we were foolish enough to put in 49 six months at Anzac- You have done good work but not had enough experience has been said to three or four of us men who have been fighting since July - men who have been doing captains and maors work Tyet with Anna and the Remforcemin Hades behind we are told too prnior. not enough experience. Majors H. & I. are excellent men they are batting hard for us - & I told me I was recommended so dve not put my tail between my legs yet. My word, Dad- the words sick & convalesient cover a lot in the casualty liste in some cases sick simply means fund - convalisient often lagmess - nolidaying, &c and as Benia remarks a number of ifit looking men are getting back to Anstratea. Its a durned shame that such musteryevers should make a blot on the name of Anzac Fancy Ireland having to be recalled - surely dity was sufficient.

My men were ioculated again yesterday - Have all yt duty this afternoon bat arms Ivery sick over o so Sreckon the M.O. overdosed them. I went out this afternoon to make a thorough reconmaning of Arabis trenches. I can't quite follow the idea of them but I have made up one or two schemes for attack & defense by my company. C has been split up a bit we have had to supply details for newly formed Artillery, Engineers, & A.S.C, sit is a bit riting to have to empty out ones company, after training them up to a certain point - then to have raw hands passed on to us. Yout be surprised to see how ignorant some & the 2t are even of ordinary regimental dunes. But anyhow I must say all the new men are keen Iit is a pleasure to handle them.

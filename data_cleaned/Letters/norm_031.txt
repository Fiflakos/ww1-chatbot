Author: Norman Griffiths Ellsworth Location: Gaba Tepe Gallipoli Peninsular TurkeyDate: 15 June 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Gaba Tepe,Gallipoli Peninsular,Turkey, 15th June 1915.Dearest Mother & all at Home,Just a few lines to let you knowthat I am quite well & in the very best of "nick" & amthoroughly enjoying this great experience. We have gotthe Turks beaten now, & they only confine themselves torepelling our attacks. We completely beat them at nightfighting, because we can fire our guns at night just aseasily as in daytime, & they dare not fire theirs, as itwould give away their positions, so you see we have thingsall our own way at this game. You will be pleased toknow that our battery has been mentioned in despatchesfor gallantry & The Major expects to get out ofit, & there are 2 D. C. Ms to go to the battery. We drewfor them out of the hat & we decided to give one to oneof the chaps on "C" Subsection who has a big chanceof losing his leg & the other went to Corporal Gammon (Yardleys corporal). The Turks use high explosiveshell on us now, & one of these came through the front ofthe pit, glanced along the gun barrel & burst through theshield; The gun layer was killed instantly & the fuze hitthe other man on the leg. This was therefore putcompletely out of action & they made up a new gun out ofmine which was walloped on my birthday, & some of the of the spare undamaged parts of Adams gun, so the resultis, My old gun is completely rebuilt & is barking louderthan ever & my detachment are just the boys to workher too. All the Drivers & horses are still in Alexandria& of course Braithwaite & Jack Hall are there too, so itlooks as if they will keep us in Gaba Tepe after theadvance has begun. No body is anxious to see Constantinoplehere, as it resembles Cairo only much dirtyr dirtier &smelly, so we don't want to go there. You will be sorryto hear about Yardley; He has got a complete nervousbreakdown & has been struck off our strength & sentto the Divisional Ammunition Column at Alexandria.One of his detachment got killed one day & poorYardley took it quite heart & let it get him down. Itdoesn't do, Mother, to let it get one down at this game& when a chap gets killed, you simply have to lifthim out of his seat, throw a coat over his head, &go on working the gun just as if nothing has happened.It seems hard, but it can't be helped.Down at Cape Helles, the British & French arebombarding the place night & day & it is one continuousroar all the time. We don't get so much assistance fromthe Navy now, as the Submarines sunk two battleshipslast week. We were only a mile from where the"Triumph" went down, & so of course we saw the whole show. "Hostile submarine" was signalled to all ships& all the battleships "up anchor" & kept moving aboutall the time, except the "Triumph" who was contentto remain at Anchor & put out her nets, but asyou know, torpoedos cut through nets, & the poor old"Triumph" found out too late, for the torpoedo struckher fair amidships & we at once saw her with slopingdecks & a big list to starboard, & all the sailors wereall "fallen in" as on parade on the after deck. Boatsof all sorts were sent to her assistance, & we saw arace of destroyers from Cape Helles & they were doing35 knots an hour, & reached her before she wentdown. Slowly she heeled over & all the sailors goton to her side which was above water & then they allleapt into the sea & were picked up by the boats.She turned right over at last & showed her propellers& then went slowly to the bottom. During this time, theTurks wher were shelling the rescue parties & men inthe water, but their shooting was poor. We only haveDestroyers along the coast now, but occasionly theFleet steams out of Lemnos at night & shells theTurks along the coast at day break for a couple ofhours & then gets away to Lemnos again. Thebattleship "Albion" went aground off Gaba Tepe onenight, & the Vengance was trying to tow her off. But the only way she could get off, was to lighten herself of shellsso she pumped out 200 broadsides of 6 inch guns intothe Turks territory, & what a sight it was too, shewas one mass of smoke & flashes & the noise wasdeafening. She was towed off however after an hoursshelling. Les Ilsley is with the New Zealanders &was in the last bayonet charge & came out all right.He rang me up on the 'Phone. The Turks wont facethe bayonet & run like blazes. Their artillery too,can't shoot for nuts; The first shot usually falls50 yards in front of our guns, & the next goes milesover our heads into the sea, the next falls to theright or left & the next may hit the pit itself.& after this it is quite safe to sit on the roof & watchfor the rest, nevertheless we don't take any risks.There is two shells in front of my gun 27 incheslong & 8 inches in diameter (unexploded) so you seewe get some little visitors occasionly. They must beshort of ammunition, because a lot of their shellsare filled with pitch & sawdust. Our conditions arequite the best available & we get the best of food, Freshmeat, Onions, Spuds, Fresh Bread, & dried fruits, Etc. soI am getting condition on again. I am often thinkingof everybody at home & I earnestly hope that youdon't worry about me, because I am quite alright I have been hit twice with shrapnel bullets & altho'they were fairly spent, nevertheless it is just likegetting hit with a stone, thrown very swiftly. Onecan hear shells coming, & so we can generallymanage to get our heads under cover, even if ourback sides don't, & strange to say, this is just whereI was struck each time. High explosive shells areonly dangerous when they actually hit the gun &the men are working it, but we are always orderedinto "funk holes" as soon as we finish firing.How is everybody at home, Give my love toall enquirers & tell them to be proud of the AustralianInfantry for the way they took this place. All theImperial Officers swear by them now.I hope you are well, Mum. Give my love to Mab,Chas & family (hope he is in work) George, Rupert, Floss,Miss Taylor, Jack Tilton & all relations.We are always delighted to get your letters from homealso the papers & I read them over & over again. I got thesocks & handkerchiefs from Mab, thanks so very much, if youcould send me a singlet or two, I should feel obliged, weget shirts & pants & coats & boots, but no singlets.Well, good bye, for the present, with bestlove to all I remainYour loving SonNorman Write to Ruby Davidson51 Highett StWest Richmond pleasealso.

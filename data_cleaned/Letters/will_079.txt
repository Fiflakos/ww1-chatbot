Author: H P Lynch Date: 14 April 1917 Nationality: British Text: 14th April, 1917My Dear BirdieThank you very much for theaccount of the attack. I thinkthe Brigades did splendidly & themen were magnificent I am verygrieved about their losses & I hopethey are not too depressed & upset.When he goes goes into the wholestory, it seems fairly clear thatHolmes would have saved a greatmany lives & gained at the sametime an enormous success, if he had promptly & resolutely pushedon his Reserves. He had 5Battalions I think unemployed_if 4 of these (a Brigade) hadgone xx on within 30 minutesof the attack starting straighton to Riencourt & even HendecourtI think he would be there now!It is an old lesson, but itrequires a soldier & it is notpossible to turn civilians into trained commanders in a fewmonths,- the wonder is that theyhave picked up so much & doneas well as they have!I saw Sir D. H. today; hesent you & the 4th Divn manymessages of sympathy over theirdisappointment . He does notwant us to go in till, the IIIArmy has got cherizy.As things now are going therewont be any much chance of our attacking beforeTuesday -However that will make moreof a certainty of the wire.Yours ever,HP Lynch.

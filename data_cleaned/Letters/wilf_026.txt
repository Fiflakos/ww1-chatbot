RegimentRacecourse Camp,Cairo.Should be + 3 January 1916, Read this letter firstHope to write to individual membersof family as soon aspossible. My dear mother,On my arrival herea few days ago I was delighted toreceive the letters for which I hadbeen longing for months, also parcels& papers. Your billy can wasthe first thing to meet the eye,and a box of [[?]] from Mab, books& writing paper from Harry & acouple of parcels which Stephenhad sent me from Egypt. All hadevidently been held up at Lemnoson account of the evacuation &sent back here. And do you know,I received four of the first lettersyou ever sent dated June &July which had been sent awayfrom 1st A. G. Hospital by mistaketo another Evans & since thenhave been wandering aboutEgypt & Gallipoli looking forme. How delightful it was toreceive such recent news of youas the end of November & to findthat you had reconciled yourselfto all my being at Gallipoli, Ifind lots of things to which Ishould reply in your letters &will read them through againwhen I am finished this & replyif necessary. But firstly pleasedo take a holiday - I hateto think of you staying altogetherin Candelo & I should be sohappy if you would take 20or as much more as you wishfrom what is being sent to youfor me & go away & kickover the traces for a whileDon't beggar yourself bygiving too liberally to war funds- we will all have to pay enoughlater on. I think I missedyour letter which stated thatErn & Alice had left you - Iwondered if it was just atthe time when I sent you my cableon going to Gallipoli. Well, letme tell you some news. We waiteda day at Alexandria beforelanding then the few men inmy regiment who were withme were enabled to go ashore& we obtained a railway warrantfor Cairo for the six train in theevening. That gave us timeto trot round Alexandria inthe day. We all lunched togetherin the morning & then I setout to look for Cousin Gwen wherever she might be.I went first to No XIXGeneral Hospital from thereto a nurses home, from thereto No XV General, & from thereto more nurses homes &eventually tracked her downbut found she was out. Itwas then about 3.30 pm.& I had to leave at 6 pm.so you can imagine thatI was disappointed. Howeverthey said she would be goingon duty at 5 pm. so I wentback to town had someafternoon tea & came backto the hospital or rather thehouse where the nurses abode& after more enquiries thelady appeared. So wesquatted down & exchangednotes but she had only 15minutes before going on dutywhich was a shame. I thoughtit too bad when one saw anoverseas cousin for the firsttime to leave in 15 minutesfor good so I chanced themilitary authorities sent theothers on by the six oclocktrain & waited for the 11.30myself. She was off dutyat 8 pm & I called roundthen expecting to go fora [[garry]] drive with her buta new rule has come outfor British nurses that theycanno are not allowed to goout with khaki so wesat & talked in the drawing room which was just as good.She told me lots of thingsabout the Evansess &was sorry she had not thefamily pedigree or what canyou call it with her - saidit was very good came fromthe Welch kings & so on - veryamusing. She is a very nicelassie 24 years old & a B.A.of Oxford where she used toplay hockey with the Intervarsityteams so must besome athlete. She has theusual peachy English complexion& blue eyes is of moderateheight & sturdy. Am notyet in love with her though Isuppose you & father will besure to think so. She toldme that Ernest Hughes is verysweet on one of her sisters - funnyisn't it. Don't pass it on toAuntie Lily. She showed mevarious photos of English cousinswhich were very interesting. Ileft about ten oclock & wentwalked over along to the hotelwhere I had left my baggageconsisting of pack, [[for tack]] waterbottle& haversack, my only worldlypossessions, all portable & theremet one of the officers whohad been ill & commentsjoined us at Lemnos & we hadquite a pleasant chat tillit was time for me to go to mytrain. I there engaged asleeping berth & dossed thereingiving instructions to the porter not to call me until 7 am.although the train arrived atCairo at 5 a.m. Then I wentto bed & woke when the mancalled me in the morning,got up & dressed & caughtthe tram to Heliopolis &walked on here. We area little crowded at presenton account of the largenumber of troops suddenlydumped into Egypt but Iwas very glad to be hereagain for a while. I wentover to the Hospital inthe afternoon & wasgreeted back cordiallyby a lot of old acquaintancesmany of whom greeted me as one returned from the deadfor rumor had it that Ihad departed this life atLemnos. Next day Wesley& I, for we had joinedup again here, went intotown together as I neededso many things - cleanunderclothes & a watch -for I had lost the oneyou gave me at Gallipoli& various other oddmentssuch as towels etc. I forgotto mention that Wesley toldme that on his boat comingover he had met my cousinMajor John Evans as I hadtold Charles about him atGallipoli & when he heardthat there was a MajorEvans aboard he accostedhim & asked him whetherhe was my cousin & foundhe was. Charley told himall about me & the oldboy was delighted tohear that I was a medico.What a coincidence wasn'tit! - Well we went toCairo & while passingShepheard's Hotel suddenlyCharley exclaimed "Whythere's your cousin now."& sure enough it was,He was delighted to seeme & told me he waspleased that I wasa doc as nearly allthe forefathers had been in the profession thatthe maker of Thomas'splints was an ancestor.It's funny that Englishpeople love ancestry& Australians don't carevery much. He was sucha jovial little man & I likedhim immensely, he remembersyou well & said to askyou if you remember makingtea for him & anotheryoung man who lived opposite.We could not stay verylong as he had to run awaybut I hope to go to Wardanwhere he is at present about1 hours trip from heretomorrow if possible & havequite a long chat.Yesterday afternoon Charley & I went into Cairo to meetBuchanan who was in our year& has been here since thecommencement of the war.His mother & sister have recentlycome over & are staying inCairo & we went with themto look over an old mosque& then to an afternoon tea atthe home of the Minister for theInterior who holds an afternoontea every fortnight for militaryfolk. Good number of peoplewere there but it was ratherboring. Went to churchafter packed full.Hand tired best love forall & a double shareto mother fromHer loving son,Wilf. The cake was a beauty, the menin the tent all send thanks.

Author: James Joseph Makin Location: FranceDate: 9 April 1916Nationality: Australian Text: France,9/4/16. Dearest Mother & Father, Just a line to let you know that since I last wrote my address has been altered slightly. It is now:- No. Name, 21st Infantry Battalion, A.I.F., 2nd A.D.B.D., C/o A.P.O - S17, B. E. F., France. There has been nothing of note since my last letter. "Everything in the garden is looking lovely and there is every prospect of rain." I am still in a training camp doing plenty of training and feeling better than ever before. It is pretty cold some days but we are used to it by now. There is not much to write about as I am always in camp and each day is practically alike. We had an easy day yesterday (Saturday). We were paid (2/3/-) and issued with tobacco. In the afternoon there was a football match between my unit and the artillery, which we won. I quite enjoyed the game and hope they will come off pretty often. We might as well be isolated at Broadmeadows as be in this camp. Apart from the few French girls and women about the camp selling oranges and collecting washing there is very little to remind us that we are in France. We are much more settled down than when we were in the Melbourne camps. Now one is much more contented to stay in camp and make the most of one another's company. It is surprising how quickly each day passes. The meals seem to come very soon after one another. It is just as well for they are not exactly Sunday dinners we are getting. Are you getting my letters regularly? I have written often and regularly so that you would not be worrying if I missed a mail. I am looking forward to getting some letters shortly. It is about time some "came to light." Did you get the parcel I sent from Egypt? I hope you did, for buying it left me "broke" for three weeks. I shall write again shortly. Love from Jim

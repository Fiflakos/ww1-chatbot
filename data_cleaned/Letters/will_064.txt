Author: Newton J Moore Date: 7 February 1917 Location: London Nationality: British Text: Bhurtpore House,Tidworth,Hants.7th February 1917My Dear GeneralI have yourletter to hand advisingme of the C-wealthGovts. proposal to appointMcCay as my successor:& I need hardly say ithas come as a verygreat disappointment &if carried into effectwill do me a greatinjustice. I appreciateindeed your letter and the references made to theGovt regarding my work.If my Administration herehad been criticised atall, I would have beenprepared to have acceptedthe position but to bedropped as is proposedwill be very detrimentalto my future career, asit will be assumed atonce that I have beena failure instead of asuccess, & my politicalenemies of whom I havea few will take advantageof it to the fullest extent.Under these circumstancesI earnestly request that at leastmy promotion as recommendedbe pressed for if I onlyhold it until the timeMcCay proposes to takeover viz the 1st April.Fisher considers I shouldappeal to the Govt. butI do not wknow whetherI could do much atthis distance.If my promotion is approved& I could be employedsay in command of theEtaples troops it wouldbe some satisfaction &a reply to any commenton my having to handover here. White comesdown tomorrow & I amtaking him through the various groups, going to Weymouththe following day.I propose after talkingmatters over with himto write you further.In the meantime mayI again say thatyour kind. letter &the appreciative mannerin which you havereferred to my serviceswill (irrespective of whatmay happen) The be recognitionwhich I shall alwaysprize.Yours sincerely,Newton J Moore

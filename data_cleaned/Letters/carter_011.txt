Author: Herbert Gordon Carter Location: Cairo Kasr-el-Nil Barracks Date: 21 March 1915 Nationality: Australian Text: Kasr-el-Nil BarracksCairo. 21/3/1915 My dear Father & Mother.The change of scene is only slight & unfortunatelynot permanent - at midday Tuesday I marched inwith my picquet (4 officers & 90 men) - My duty was tosend men round the town - to maintain order amongthe soldiery, also to send them all home after 10 oclock.I am able to get a fair idea of the truth of the statementsabout the troops' behaviour & I'm Exactly of the sameopinion as before. There are a few rows, but theyare as a rule easily squashed, the drunken men standto attention & salute most ceremoniously when you callthem to book - Every morning I have to go to theBab-el-Hadid barracks & sign all the charge sheetsof the men arrested.-

Author: Stephen Allen Location: FranceDate: 1 March 1917 Rank: Private Nationality: Australian Text: Dear Mrs Allen,As I have beenaway in England woundedI only received Miss Allen'sletter yesterday so pleaseexcuse my delay in replyingI am extremely sorry thatI am unable to give youmuch hope as regardsyour two sons. On the nightof August 14th the 13thBattalion in conjunctionwith other regiments madean attack on thatfamous German strongholdMouquet Farm. It wasone of the most gloriouscharges in which theAustralians have participatedas the machine gun fire whichthey were called upon to facewas terrific. Our lads gotright across but their And as regiments on ourflanks failed we had toretire. We brought back anumber of Germans prisonersand most of our ownwounded. There was afaint possibility that yourtwo sons were takenprisoners consequently theywere posted as missingbut if you have not yetreceived intimation thatthey are in Germanhands I think you mustmake up your own mind thatthey fell gallantly, whilepushing forward in thatglorious charge. All thosethat were left of the10th reinforcements (thereare very few now) wereextremely sorry that thetwo brothers were gone.They were like byall ranks and weregood soldiers and willing losses were very heavy fighters. Although theyhave given up their livesthey did their duty noblyand well. Please acceptmy deepest sympathy.Yours very sincerelyT. Willis, Captain13th Battalion. A.I.FP.S. Your boys, if killed,will have been buriedalong with a large numberof their Australian comradeson the field of battle,near Mouquet farm, whichis about a mile fromPozieres.

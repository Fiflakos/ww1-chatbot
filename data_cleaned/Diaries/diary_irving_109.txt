Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 2 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. Jun. 2, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good BABY two months old today. May God spare her for us and keep her and Leah in good health. Up at 6:45. Have had a good night's rest. Feel much refreshed. Wash. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. A poor meal. System of feeding by platoon not a success, in our platoon at least. Non-coms get their bellies full but privates go hungry. If a man asks for more to eat or attempts to get any by deceit, he is abused and sworn at, sometimes for the same thing that the non-coms do. I write a letter to Sam Friedman, before I go to work, all but a few lines. In office before Fox arrives. Manage to make good progress. Keep well ahead of Fox at all times, arranging so I can write a few letters in afternoon. Many officers in during forenoon. Gas Lt. Beers among them but seems to have forgotten about general orders about wearing gas masks. 10 and 10:30 comes and goes without mention of hateful task being made. Finish all but E. Co. roll before leaving for lunch. Hard tack, bully beef stew, lime juice, a new thing on the bill of fare. It is a good cooling drink. Finish letter to Sam and write to Mama while I rest after lunch. Back to office at 1:30. Supply Sgt. Morten busy compiling statement of rations on hand for Lt. in charge. There is something in it which puzzles him greatly. We are not very welcome. Rather than disturb him I think it advisable to go outside to do my work. I could do very little upstairs under the circumstances because he is tearing his hair and swearing like a trooper. Sit on stone steps at entrance to Hdqrs. in hot sun. I take off my hat to get the full benefit of it. Fox complains but stays like an obedient lad until I find it entirely too hot for comfort. Look about for a shady spot. Find one, though no comfortable spot to sit down. Try it for a few minutes. Both of us complain. Fox goes upstairs to ascertain if Sgt. has finished his work. We have the room to ourselves. They have gone. Write a new letter to Etta. Borrowed paper. A small item to crow about, but even a piece of paper has high value here and if I can save a sheet out of my own stock, I feel as if I have done something to be proud of. How easily a man becomes small. Write to Leah. Fox has caught up with me. It is necessary to go on with my work. Stay with it until 5 o'clock. Get to billets in time for mess. Cheese, jam, bread, coffee. Told that I have been assigned to corporal Rist's squadron 1st platoon. Glad that I have finally been taken out of the 3rd, composed mostly of rowdies. What is more, it has always been my wish to someday belong to the 1st, a nicer, more intellectual set of boys. It is perhaps well to move to the area they occupy. Since they have been in quarantine on account of Al Ferguson's case of anthrax, they have pitched tents in the field. I would much prefer to tent. Sgt. Greenstein sends for me. Tells me that he would like to have me attend to whatever sketches it will be necessary to make when out on work which requires it. I consent gladly. Chat with him for a few minutes. Cpl. Haight comes along. Tells me with a tone of finality that Co. goes into action Saturday morning. Says that he will go with company instead of doing office work. He is elated at the prospect of going into action. I become very much excited. Ask Sgt. if anyone in his platoon is looking for a bunkie. Find that Reagan is without a partner. Agree to come down about nine and pitch a tent with him. To hide my feelings I do not stay to hear more from Haight. Much disappointed that what I most dread (the probability of being in trenches on my wedding anniversary) seems about to be realised. I summon my courage to the task of finishing Leah's letter. Try very hard not to let letter betray anything of what I feel. It has been a cheerful letter up to this point. I succeed fairly well in finishing it in the same strain as it began. Spend another half hour writing. Then get together my belongings. A difficult job to find it all. During excitement of yesterday's expected inspection of billets most of my things have been thrown about or hidden. Reilly aids me and promises to carry some of my load to new quarters. Blankets and wearing apparel, pack carrier, gun, steel helmet on head, I move out. No parting formalities. Do not owe anybody a word of thanks. Reilly carries, shoes, shelter half, mess kit and a few other small articles. He turns me over to Reagan with a recommendation for sobriety and good habits. Almost dark. Reagan busy. Lie down until he is ready to get down to pitching our tent. Dougherty, next tent, is telling men of our coming movements, in particulars similar to what I have been told by Haight. I do not corroborate nor deny what he tells. Put up our tent. Chat with Reagan and Dougherty for half an hour after. Turn in with intentions of going to sleep at once. Reagan has a bad headache, which does not permit him to sleep. Therefore he keeps me awake for almost two hours talking on general topics. I make mention of what I have been told concerning coming movement. He is dumbfounded. Remains silent almost long enough for me to fall asleep. Recovers his speech again. I have to bid him goodnight. Sleep well. I dream of him and a Kosher meat butcher. I have been too busy to know what has been going on during the day. I do not remember hearing the report of a single gun and as for airplanes, I cannot recall seeing or hearing any except one which hovers over us at night while we talk in our tent. It is quite cold and damp. Have a little difficulty with blankets. My few spare minutes during the day taken up exclusively with thoughts of Cecilie and Leah. It occurs to me to caution Leah to take good care of baby during the hot summer months to come. I am a bit worried by thoughts of how periods of heat effect babies.

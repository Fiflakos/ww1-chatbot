Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 27 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. May 27, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Mild Health: Good Up at 6:00. Wash. Police up. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee, butter. Go out to work early. One party resumes work on OP. 1st Lt. takes a party out. I am with 2nd Lt. and Sgt. We look for a suitable field of fire for a machine gun. We must also find a good place for outpost and another point from which observation can be taken. A slowly moving job. Lt. wants suggestions from us. We are very ignorant of subject but we all make bold efforts to conceal it. In some cases, we are successful. I traverse woods a number of times during early forenoon to locate position. In the course of one trip, I find a pile of faggots among which I see one I would like to have for a stick. I will ape the fashion of the English, most of whom carry a stick. I whittle it and shave it of bark, while we are on our survey. It develops I will need an aid to walking. Lt. has a passion this morning for walking over trench system again and taking bearings. Peculiar. In comparison to 1st Lt. he gives us not a minutes rest. We walk all morning. Finish up by going through woods again to check up a bearing. Come out at spot which to my mind is far from right, but apparently it is taken as exact. Machine guns firing in range makes Lt. fear for safety. We must go into woods again to CF in which to advance under cover. Mess. Beef stew, hard tack, coffee. As I am having my tin filled we hear a sound as of a rushing in air. A distinct whistle and rustling among the leaves. A second later a tremendous bang. The ground rocks. It seems to have passed directly over our heads and struck not far from us. I am frightened. This is Fritz's first whizzbang. It suggests itself to me that Englishman whom we think is a spy has disclosed our position. He has not made an appearance today, which adds to my suspicions. Another one comes over before we finish mess. I lie down in tent to write no matter what happens. Some of the boys go to the end of enclosure to see what shell hit. Nothing to be seen but a cloud of dust or smoke quite a distance away. A company of Englishman manoeuvering in woods behind us. They are firing a trench mortar which with bombardment of usual intensity from front and Fritz's little reminder to us every ten minutes or so makes a fairly deafening racket. I try to form conjectures of the damage the shells are making, the loss of life which they are causing. I shudder. We lie around until 3:30. Informed that Battalion will inspect trenches tonight. They will camp out behind lines. Lt. takes a party to meet them and escort them to lines of defense allotted to the different companies. I go out with 2nd Lt. on a tour of observation. 3 posts established. We must imagine our men when they come, are the enemy, and observe and note their movements. Also anything that takes place in meantime which would be of military importance. He tries to trick us but I catch him at it and record his movements. He is pleased at our acuteness. By six no enemy in numbers has appeared. He rounds us up and takes us in to supper. Post #2 has seen F. Company. Supper. Cheese, bread, jam, coffee. Time for another shell dropping party from the enemy. Soon 5E Company comes in. Our men return. A concert at farmhouse in pasture. Shelling begins again with same objective. Reports of casualties come in. Deaths in Anzac camp and along ......... road. Apparently they are trying for RR behind road, and important line of communication. I wonder how our men are reconciled to being greeted thus for their first visit to the trenches. Our scouts report anxiety in camp. At dusk, an air raid on same objective. Frequent shelling and machine gun fire directed in air. Enemy also trying for 2 of our observation balloons. Barrage and intermittent shelling from our men in enemy direction. I go to bed at dark. Say a fervent prayer for protection of our men. At times it seems as if our camp is being hit. Lying in tent explosions from big shells are much louder than when I was up. They almost jolt me off ground. I cannot sleep in spite of fact I am tired. It is cold and frosty too. My shoulders and back will not stay warm. Every time I doze off a shell bursts with a sound sufficient to wake the dead. At about one a fierce battle is waged in the air. Machine guns shell and searchlights play. Three bombs are dropped. A big shell bursts at same time. A wild night. No sleep for me. Our guard loads and locks his piece. He is anxious for our safety. I shiver when I think that it is worse than this at the front tonight. It seems hardly possible, yet it must be so. I envy my tentmate who snores unconcernedly. What would Leah say if she knew.

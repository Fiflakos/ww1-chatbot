Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 22 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. Jun. 22, 1918 Weather: Showers, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. There will be formation for Reveille this morning in the rain, wearing tin hats, no umbrellas. Breakfast, beans, Karo, bread, coffee. Formation for the day announced. Newsman comes. He gets an ovation. Rumour is infectious. He blows his horn frequently to draw remarks from the men. Wash, clean gun to be ready for possible inspection. Raining considerably, which minimized possibility of formation this morning, so I begin writing. Called out for the purpose of debating questions which have come up regarding the company Mess. Non- coms, particularly platoon sergeants have complained to Company Commander, that food is both poor in quality and insufficient for sustenance. Lt. Cook, therefore, calls company together to explain that we have an English cooker, intended originally and constructed for a company of only 100 men. If anyone can suggest how to make it do more work, than the cooks at present on the job get out of it, he will listen gladly. It must also be taken into consideration that cooker needs repairing. Anyone is welcome to volunteer either services or suggestions of value to remedy defects in it. Does anyone know how meat can be cooked in a different manner from what cooks have been serving? It takes one hour to settle argument. Haas, Bezer and others have suggestions. I laugh at them. Personal tastes are not company tastes. Sugarman volunteers as cook. He has had experience in New York hotels. A butcher was picked for work in the kitchen. Lt. gives some men permission to go to ..........., where a number of stoves and dixies have been seen lying around, to bring back same. If anyone knows where kitchen utensils can be purchased, they will receive permission to go. Great expectations for noon mess. Dismissed. No formation until afternoon. A new Sgt., Burres, suggests we practice putting on respirators. Those who are in barracks line up and while away half an hour in gas mask drill. Go over letter I wrote to Leah, making some corrections. A visit to the YMCA to get some paper and inquire about cablegrams and how to send. Rubin wants to know. Mess really a surprise to the boys. It was worthwhile complaining, is the general verdict. Soup, boiled beef, bread and butter, potato, all done to perfection. Non-coms are in line same as privates as per order of Lt. Strange to see Sgt. Kaplan at end of line. Formation announced for 1:15. Slickers, gas masks, helmets, rifles. It is clear and much too warm for slickers and tin hats. Go to rifle range. A detail picked to act as scorers and pasters. Men who had much experience in shooting picked for job. I and remaining scouts will not shoot. One half of company in another field for hand grenade work. Range in a square, a hollow, trees on 4 sides. We shoot at poor targets, corrugated paper. Soon plugged full of holes. Paste and paper soon gives out. Two sections of company alternate their work. Men who have shot, going to bombing field, and bombers come to shoot. Machine guns squad have no opportunity to use rifles. They devote entire afternoon to Souchard under French officers. Our Captain Mills attempts to shoot Souchard's gun from shoulder. Kick almost knocks him over in spite of his weight. Tries it from hip with better results. As a grand finale Lt. has corporals fire ten shots each at a tin can, intending to count the number of perforations in the can at the end of a minute. Go up to get it. It is a wreck. More holes in it than anyone cares to count. Company goes back. Led off in squads to prevent enemy from taking pictures of any larger bodies of troops. Dismissed. Mess as soon as we get back. Stew, potato, coffee, bread. Meal voted a success. Much praise for our new cooks. New system for serving again gives good results. Begin writing a letter to Nuck and the boys. I am risking a great deal in writing it. It may give offense to officials, there being a possibility that what I write in a humourous vein be taken seriously by censoring officer. It is too good to destroy, in my opinion. I read as much of it as I have finished to Rubin and the other men in the next bunk. I must borrow a candle to continue writing after dark. I consume two or three candle ends before I finish. It is eleven o'clock when I finally extinguish light to please men who wish to sleep. I finish letter but do not revise it. Tonight there has been another mass meeting before our doors, of men who tell each other how the war can be won. If only they are fortunate enough to be permitted to go to the line, they will illustrate their methods of going over to visit Fritz, etc. Everyman has an infallible system. Just before sundown the usual engagements in the air are fought over the lines. The town alarm is sounded at which all men must get under cover. Being unconcerned as to danger, our men congregate in doorway and under eaves of barracks to watch shells bursting in air. Announcement made for tomorrow's calls. Reveille will be at 6:30. During the night a number of isolated shots are fired. F and H companies must be having a quiet time of it in the trenches in spite of a dozen rumors to the contrary that they have been shot up. Some of their men who have been guarding rations and supplies at ........., come up to join battalion and are quartered with us for rationing. Everyone quickly detects them as strangers and protests against feeding them. A selfish lot. To bed at 11:15. Sleep well. Told that Jacobson, G. Company, has been transferred to field artillery. One of our new Sgts. and Powers have a discussion about proper way to wear tin helmet.

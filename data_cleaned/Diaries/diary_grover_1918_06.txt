Went in to Englebelmer and got roses1 & currents in p.m. Notes. 1 At this point Grover is traveling southeast of Doullens. 1 This is a post from the Great Was Forum: Ann, many American doctors were attached to BEF units for front line and trench experience from 1917. Sounds like your Great Uncle was attached to an artillery unit of the Royal Artillery. A battery was a unit of a number of guns each of a single type size and weight although different batteries had different size guns. When deployed for action the battery would be set up behind the front line within range of the enemy. A forward observation post was set up in the front line where observers could spot enemy targets and, via telephone, call down fire on them and also relay corrections of fall of shot. Later on in the war this could also be done by aerial spotting and simple wireless (Morse code) telegraphy. All guns were horse drawn so once the battery was positioned, usually in a line of a section of 3 or 4 guns, the horses and supporting wagons would be withdrawn to the rear out of range of enemy artillery fire. These were the waggon lines where the horses were kept, men came back for rest food was prepared etc. Each night the guns and men would be resupplied with ammunition, rations etc by wagons from the wagon lines under cover of darkness. In the case of an emergency advance or retreat the horses had to be rapidly summoned from the rear to move the guns. (from salientguide)

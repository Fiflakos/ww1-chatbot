Jan. 7, 1918 Weather: cold, sleet, ice Health: good I am worried about Leah Up at 6:00. It was raining torrents. Much to my surprise. No Reveille. Breakfast, oatmeal, hash, coffee. Prospects for doing outside work not very good. Walking impossible. One of our men slips and injures head. We have 8 men today who are prisoners. Followed by guard wherever they go. Read paper. Practice with Holliwell targets in Recreation Room. Out of 20 shots my score is good. Read Popular Mechanics. Signal practice, semaphore. We send signals. Setting up exercises for an hour. Dinner, beef stew, rice and raisins. Reagans conduct becomes annoying. Arrogant. In Mess Hall we are taught to adjust our rifle slings to prone and kneeling positions. We get lecture on sanitation and prophylaxis. With rifles, position and aiming exercises. Then for a hike on ice-covered roads without rifles. Get back in time for Retreat. Capt. reads sentences imposed on prisoners for taking leave. About Rosenbaum and Henchwiser, They will be shipped South and dealt with there. They are no longer members of Company E Thank God, which I do not approve. I was frightened at the thought of the South. My name is posted for KP for a week beginning Wednesday. Supper, spaghetti, prunes, coffee. Write. Read regulations for non-coms and privates. Go to PO and to telephone Leah. She is well to my great relief. Take a bath and wash socks and handkerchiefs. Open windows and go to bed. My bath was hurried because Curry was there and if any 2nd platoon man had come in he would fared badly and so I. To bed at 10 and sleep poorly. Had promised to visit Mark but do not on account of weather. One month here today. Clean latrine.

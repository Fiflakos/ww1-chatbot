Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 27th October 1914. Nationality: Australian. Tuesday Oct. 27th We are anchored in St Georges Sound with 22 others Albany seems to be some miles away and through the narrow opening between the huge grand granite rocks that make decent sized Islands. The fellows would like to get on land but are fairly patunt patient and seem to be getting much more contented with the food & general ship life. I can see another 7 or 8 weeks of it and quite prepared to put get through the monotony and confinement of it all. I posted an article to Hollingworth for publication in one, or any, of the papers the Herald for preference. I wrote a 9 page letter to May Fpench she won't know what to make of me as there is a story. I overheard between the infantry men so ful of swearing. I gave her a lot on Astronomy and scenic beauties also. To W.Z.B. I wrote six pages and confessed much of my xxx longing for her, and at the same time giving her liberty to get another man; if he is a man, I won't grumble. I would not say this, but how is it possible for me to offer anything in the way of comfort and convenience. Yet it will come hard to part with her, and I cannot keep her waiting for what may be a forlorn hope. When I reason coldly Win is no good to me, but my heart won't agree and seeks her wildly. I am with Mess No. 52. E. in charge of Corporal Gregg Donnellan and consists of 20 men, two of whom are appointed permanent mess orderlies they draw the food and serve it up from the head of the table. As they have hard work to do we each put in d per week and give them 10/- each. They are Hucking and O'Sullivan. The first named is an raw North of Englishmen and a rather slow thinking, dull witted type he carries the troubles of the whole mess on his heavily burdened shoulders, and is in his most congenial mood when he can get the fellows asking for things he then airs his officiousness in a majestic manner. To grool growl is a special delight, and to be short of food, and complain of the fellows eating too much is a boom to him. His off-sider, O'Sullivan, has been a much sworn at fellow every since he joined the ranks, that is now 8 weeks ago. and he cannot march in step to save his life. I thought it quite impossible for any man not to learn his right leg or hand from the left after having an instructor and everybody who marches behind him calling out 20 times each parade Yet "Sully" is a cheerful optimistic sort of fellow without a hard word to say about anyone; though I have heard him telling Hacking he was worst, worse than an old woman and that he was full of working with him Sully is left-handed and can never serve out either the porridge or the tea evenly, the first few plates are filled up then the quantity decreases until the last few get but very little and a possibility of nothing at all being left for himself. This often occurs and then it is a funny pantomint pantomime to hear Hacking and Sully in wordy warfare. Sully is always satisfied, the other man is never so; Although he is surprisingly consciencious he is extreml extremely jealous. I just had a glass of beer in the Sargents mess they have a barrel there and are allowed a glass three times a day. The Sargents mess cost 3/6 per day the privates 1/9. I am on guard to-day. Dressed in full uniform we are on 4 hours and off 8 hours but we must remain in the stuffy guard room all day long. Wednesday.

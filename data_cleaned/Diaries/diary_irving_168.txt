Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 1 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Thu. Aug. 1, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Lots of cooties Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Wash, shave, police, put blankets out to air. The news of the morning is that there was a gas alarm sounded at the front and it was carried back as far as P........ , where it was heard from by us. Germans came over, but a little too soon. They were spied on the skyline and sent back with losses. We, that is the 1st battalion of the .......th, lose 5 men - 1 killed - 4 wounded. From that it argues that every time we make a relief, the Boche knows about it. He was evidently intent on cutting us up a bit, same as he did to 6 of our own regiment. There are the usual aeroplanes up this 252morning. They can be heard but not seen, directing artillery. Try to read the story I have written for Leah. It seems I like so much trash to me, so I give it up. Begin to read. I have found again the book that I started, "That Printer of Udell" and I mean to finish it. Sergeant announces work for the morning. We must get out of the way before the Major or somebody complains about our idleness. The work in hand will be a problem in patrolling. We go to the woods for the purpose, a quarter mile down the road and to the left. We get a little lecture about the nature of the work in hand, after we stack arms and make ourselves comfortable, and then we are allowed to rest, for 30 minutes, before we go to work. Gillece put in charge of E, a corporal for each other company. Take their men out to all points in the wood and endeavor to close in on a central point, simulating night conditions, traveling as silently as possible. We treat it as a joke at first, but later work with Barney well enough for the sergeant to pronounce our work worthy of merit. Another rest, so that we can partake of strenuous half hour's work later. In the meantime, while the sergeant and his corporals are planning how to capture an imaginary machine gun post, we capture a huckleberry patch. Before our tongues can become properly black, we are called to battle. I crawl and creep and halt and look around in silence, as far as possible. I try to avoid the sound of twigs breaking and dry leaves rustling, but that cannot be done in spite of the greatest effort. We capture the machine gun, bring it back within our lines and are given the rest of the morning off. Perhaps the Sgt. sees how anxious we are to get back to the blueberry patch. We get further away from the road into a patch which has a million big berries. I pick and eat them until I can eat no more. I must be dragged away from them by Howe. Make a stop every time I see a good cluster. After I can eat no more, I lie down on a bed of dry leaves and smoke a pipe until I fall asleep thinking how easy a life we are leading. At 11, we are taken back to the billet for dinner. Arrive a half hour or so too soon. Spend the time writing in my bunk. Dinner. Beef, sauce, flapjacks, blackberry jam, coffee. There is no work for the afternoon. I finish writing, then for want of something better to do, I take a nap. I make another attempt to read my manuscript, but not being interested in it, there is no use, no compelling interest. After my nap I feel like playing a game of pussy cat. Select ....... to play with. The first game I beat him by a fluke. The next game is lost by me in the same manner. Read until supper time. Mess. Meatballs, potatoes, bread, coffee. There are a few games worked on the mess sergeant for the purpose of procuring seconds. None of them are very successful. Take a vacation from writing to-day. Ask who wants to play pussy cat. Get into one game. Work hard and sweat much. Ride a bicycle down hill and up for the exercise. It is a good bit of work bringing the cycle uphill. Most everybody rides up and down once. Farrell gives an exhibition of trick riding. He is adept at getting close to objects without running into them. He brushes the trousers of a man with the front wheel of the bicycle. Those who come along the road seem to think that he is having difficulty in riding a bicycle. Entertainment is the order of things to-night. Black, Himpler and Kelly give us a song and dance. Black makes us laugh with his silly antics. As it grows dark, I take a letter to the Lt. for his OK, thinking that he will not take the trouble to read it. Doherty has a request for supplies signed, which spoils my chances. Gillece brings some mail. I cannot understand why I have none and why of late, so many of Leah's letters are lost. Doherty gets a package. It looks like candy. I will watch his movements. We are all around him in the rear of the barracks, when Schlesinger brings a 253French party with him. They give us some bread and furnish some very good entertainment for us. One of them sings for us in imitation of a phonograph. The fidelity of his reproduction is remarkable and his voice is one of the finest I have heard in the army. He is cheered and applauded by all the boys in the barracks. Attract men from F Co., among them two boys who can sing well. They shine for the benefit of the Frenchmen. They vie with each other. The bread is eaten at the party, with the addition of some Karo syrup. Lights are being lit. Yesterday everybody was afraid of the light; that they would attract planes. To- night, it is forgotten and lights are lit all around. There is nothing to disturb the quiet of the evening. Doherty distributes the candy. The order to move has finally come through. It is known that we move tomorrow. The line of march is decided upon and mapped out for the scouts. Too bad nobody knows where we go. It gives the boys many sleepless nights. Doherty is rather out of luck receiving the package of candy to-night. He will not be able to carry it in addition to his necessary personal belongings, so he gives as much of it away as he can. The usual barrage of things that are not attached begins. Howe and Wade begin a little drunken brawl, which is friendly but to a stranger would seem to be in earnest. Between the two of them, I am entertained with some of the choicest bits of repartee I have ever heard. Were it not for the fact that it is smutty, it would be classic. To-day and for sometime past, I have felt as if I would very much like to be home with Leah. I must own up to being homesick. I do my best to fight it off, but of myself it is not possible, therefore it is providential that entertainment, even of an amateur kind, should draw my thoughts away from myself. I forget for the rest of the night. I am reminded of more cheerful things like the vaudeville we saw at ........ and the entertainments we have given among ourselves. It is quiet about 12 but for Wade and Howe. Levine comes in at 12 looking for a searchlight to enable him to go to N....... and return with a message. No one but Schlesinger has a light worth anything. He is awakened by Levine and Wade both, but refuses to give away his light. He is justly cursed and sworn at. Levine gets a light from another fellow, which will answer the purpose. A limber driver is lost in the woods. Wade is a good fellow. Offers to help him find his way out of the woods. Rations are given the men - 1 can of beef, 2 cans of crackers and nine biscuits. Burn up some of Leah's letters and all others. A hateful task. The boys tease me about it until I grow angry. Get rid of all envelopes. Find out accidentally that Wolff, one of our detachment, is a stone hand, which sets me to wondering if I can still impose a form. He, too, tries. We go to it. I have quite forgotten how.

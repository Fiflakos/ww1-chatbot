Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 10 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. May 10, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Chill Health: Good Up at 6:00. Last on mess line for fried ham, bread, oatmeal, coffee. Cold enough to warrant wearing overcoat. Eat standing up, moving about to keep warm. Corporal of machine gun squad is in trouble. He is trying to put certain parts together without success. As I watch I fancy I see reason I call his attention to defect, probable trouble. Assures me appointment as machine gun man. Hash is cooked. I will surely become a member of suicide club. Back in quarters for a few minutes. Make an effort to get on a change of clothes, but damp chill weather makes me change my mind. Instead, go to my duties at Hdqrs. Just manage to avoid running into Capt. on my way up. Major and adjutant already at work. Something in the nature of a manoeuver is expected. An air of excitement prevails. Bend my back over task all morning, my knees freezing, toes numb, uncomfortable for want of a smoke, which I cannot indulge in on account of presence of Major. The important message from the Colonel arrives. The Battalion will camp out for the night. Brief but precise. A lot of work necessary to get proper instructions to the 4 companies, supply officers, medical detachment, etc. Guard to be arranged. Rations and duties of men who remain behind to be considered, under which group I fall. Typewriter busy for the rest of the forenoon. Go to mess. Look wise. Think with a selfish, internal smile of the hard joke to be played on men, but tell nobody. I am not certain if the CO wants me to go with company . Inquire of adjutant. Best for me to stay. Get my rations. Back to work. Everybody working feverishly on preparations for spending the night in the open. Does not let up until 3 when from an unofficial source comes the news that Colonel has rescinded his order of the morning. No reason stated. The Major of course, will not strike camp until confirmation is received from Colonel to stop proceedings. Major a calm person. I admire him. Go out to end the game. Major and adjutant return after drill recall, buzzing about a possible order to pack up during the night for a hike and all of tomorrow afield. Orders issued in black. Nobody must know. It is to be a surprise. Ten minutes later every man in camp knows about it. Men worried in the extreme. Do not know whether to unroll packs. It is cold. They need blankets. On other hand if order does come to move out during night, it will not be possible to roll packs in the dark. Pester officers for information. Told to unroll. Liaison men ordered to remain packed, sleep in clothes, ready to turn out instantly if needed. Work until 5:15. Late for supper. Cheese, apple butter, bread, coffee. Hungry with a vengeance. Cannot wheedle anyone into giving me more food. Repeatedly asked to give information of probable movements of company. Keep a silent tongue in my head. Drop only vaguest hints to men about blankets. Write after mess. I have received a letter from Lottie written the 8th, telling me a lot about the little one. Wash myself. Stroll to the village. Look into Major's office for Tallon. Strange to say he is not busy. Will he have the bottle of red wine I promised him? Gladly. Best place, favorite place? None. Corner opposite church. Order a bottle of red wine, 4 francs, sit along the wall side by side dissecting the National Army into classes, good points, bad points. Noncoms weak point, personnel, spirit, morale also. Air our individual grievances, our troubles before and after enlisting. Good jobs, bad jobs. I am interested in that. I want a job of my own, danger no object. Immunity from constant orders my objective. I want to work on my own hook no matter how lowly job is. Drink half a bottle. Part at nine. Shop closes. Guard finishes my glass. Remain in conversation for a few minutes in road. Tallon to office, I to billets. Feeling warm, active-minded, steady step. Bunkmate surprised when I light a match. Ten minutes chaff. Fall into a doze. Denarino, 3rd platoon liaison man just came in. Has been given orders as above about probable call. Wakes all of us, ordering men to roll packs and get ready to fall out. Questioned, he insists he has orders. About ready and resigned to cruel fate when someone worms from Italian the truth. He had been told probably. He misunderstood to inform us of probability. His explanation garbled, of no value. At any rate, we know of probability. Wakeful for an hour. An interesting hour with my accelerated thoughts, Leah and baby Cecilie, the burden of course. I have no inkling of any major military move. No bombardment heard. Only a few practice shots, bombs, grenades, machine guns. Bulletins report quiet on all fronts. Sleep undisturbed entire night. Aircraft not in action today in this vicinity. Warm and clear evening. Promise of fair day tomorrow. Haight looks for allotment blanks. Cannot find any. Poke. Exasperating surly cuss.

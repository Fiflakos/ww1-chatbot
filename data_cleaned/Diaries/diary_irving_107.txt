Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 31 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. May 31, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Wash. Police. Men must go out early to lead company over ground, therefore we eat early. Bacon. bread, coffee. For desert a few shells are sent over by Fritz. He is using poor ammunition. 6 or 7 do not explode. I expect to go out along with the boys. Surprised. Lt. reads names of men wanted. Same as those used when last Cos. were here. Nothing for me to do but loaf, as Griffiths goes away too. Ditches dug by us, to drain in case of rain, must be filled in. After this what? A great shame that this should have to end. I have become attached to mode of living and more particularly like to stay, account of superiority of rations. Of those who stay in camp, 4 play poker, and I write in my tent lying on my side till it aches, and the rest haggle over the water question. Who is to go? To rid myself of kinks, I volunteer to go for as much as I can carry. Gillece likewise. We go to farmhouse. Fill dixie and can. A shell comes out of the sky without any warning at all. Sounds as though it would end all in the farmyard. It falls very close at hand, behind hedge, in open. No one hurt. I go out to gate to look. Meet Major and General strolling into Division Hdqrs. I wait their disappearance before I begin my investigation. Reassured that no one is skyward, we fill canteens and dixies. Remove masks, which we have been wearing since starting for water. It so happens Lt. comes back just as I was ready to leave with an order that masks must be worn half hour in afternoon every day. It is rather inconvenient, I venture to say. So much the better. We must become accustomed to inconvenience. Wear them half way back. Englishman tells us they must be taken off. Another shell lands close to us before dust from the first one has chance to settle. I run to entrench in a hedge to wait for the next one, determined to be an eyewitness to the damage it would cause. Enemy must be aware of my purpose. He does not wish to entertain me. Must go back to prosaic task of taking down tent and putting surplus in blanket roll. Mine is mostly surplus. I notice others who have mostly surplus. A few carry their shoes, slickers, underwear, etc. I reason, if limber will carry overcoats and blankets, slickers, shoes, then a great many other things can go along just as well. Finish in time to lean against my pack for a back rest, when eating lunch. Steak, fried onions, fried potatoes, prunes, coffee, bread. More was advertised, but there were no takers. Englishman visits us to get what he can by way of farewell. We find some members of a wiring school in front of our tent. They are as ambitious as we are. No cause to be, for they do not go home yet. Officer with them thirsty, asks me for a drink. Write. Lt. goes away for a few minutes, summoned by Major. Limber comes. Put on blankets and surplus rations. Lie down to rid myself of a feeling of heaviness in the region of the stomach. Were it not for that, I would not have been able to walk. It is caused by drinking water when we have a greasy meal. I have still an hour before detachment goes back to companies. Nap. Company of Scotsman playing at war again. We are off at 3:30. Supposed to be wearing masks till 3:30, so Lt. takes us into shade of path till then for greater comfort. Company not ready yet. They are making up a pack entirely different from usual. I have a white bag strapped on back, such as no other man in company has. It can be noticed at once. Decide not to say anything. Lots of officers gravitate about it. I have a valid excuse to offer if I am called upon. I have been to school. The usual changing of fashions by adjutant. I account satisfactorily for the bag when I am asked by Lieut. Four o'clock starting time approaches and style correct or incorrect we must start. Platoon turned so that little men lead. A good idea. Going very slow. Hot. Fall out for rest after 35 minutes. Lie on road. English officer in car stops to inspect packs. Pass a shell hole, one of those which has been meant for RR near ........., our second resting place. A shell whistles directly over our heads, but buries itself in the ground, without doing any damage whatever. Had this one exploded, there would have been some casualties among our men, close to road as they were. Staying power exceeds my expectations. Of course, I have a shorter pack than they, but I have not had any training lately. Airplanes scout overhead. Fall out again in a tall clover field. Very cool and refreshing. Back in our old billets a half hour later. A big surprise to me to see us disband and dismissed without any formal ceremony. We walk into our quarters any fashion, though back to original mode of living. I vastly prefer tenting in open. Off pack, bathe in water from canteen at once. Cooled off. Go to orderly room for mail. To be distributed later. Supper. Cheese, bread, jam, coffee. Distributed by our Sgts. Bad system. Not enough to eat after long hike. Stay to listen to Sgt. Lemmon tell of experiences in front line. Marvel at the system that makes a man like him Sgt. Shave. Wallent brings in the mail. Four letters from Leah, one from Sam Friedman. He has a soft berth in France with Pershing. Read letters. Saddened at the news that a misunderstanding exists between Mama and Leah about baby. Clean gun to be ready for Saturday inspection. I expect to drill with company tomorrow. With that in mind, take especial care to have clean gun and bayonet. Even polish up my uniform. Go down to get my blanket roll. Brought on limber and is somewhere near horse corral. I find it with a little difficulty and bring it back to billets. Open pack and roll and put away things as best as possible. Reilly makes bed. I am afraid that we will get little sleep account no straw on ground. Reilly is lazy. Should have been down long before this. Kronenberg gives me an orange. Notable for being the first orange I have tasted in 2 months. Bathe my feet in cold water. Go to bed as soon as conversation with rumormongers permits. There is no sleep in store for me. My eyes close against my will. But hard floor and noise of drunken Fallace and half-witted Mario discussing each others merits, a combination that absolutely prevents sleep. Nothing of note comes to my knowledge from our front. Condition remains same after a day of partial rest. Following rumored destination when next we move, for which we are once more all together. Phillipines, Panama Canal, Italy with Pershing.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 20 April 1918. Location: England. Nationality: Australian. Text: Saturday April 20, 1918 Weather: Rainy, Cloudy Health: Headache In England Up at 5:30. Reveille. We are in dock. Monster structure of brick and steel. It is warmer. Slight drizzle falling. Suburbs on other side of the river now present a perfect picture of order. Every house built of identical material, same color, same height. Well kept streets and beautiful lawns. Promenade decks of ship. Buy a newspaper from boy who comes up gangplank which is guarded to prevent men from getting off. Auxiliary cruiser, one of our escorts on trip over, warped to pier 6 feet away. Get some information about trip from seaman, also names of towns opposite and other information of value. Fill canteen with fresh water from city supply. Rations are issued. Loaf of bread, an apple, two hard boiled eggs, a slab of cheese and a can of bully beef. Packs are made up in readiness for moving. Hold policed. Lie down till 2:30. Miss my dinner. Relieved just in time to move with my company. Run into mess hold. Get a slice of ham and some hot coffee. Go to infirmary for pills. Company L man there who has slipped on deck and broke an ankle. He will go to hospital to be forwarded to his company when he recovers. Company assembled on deck, marched onto pier and outside to railroad yards. Much of interest. See an English bobby for first time. Overhead railways, compartment cars. Freight cars about half the size of ours marked to hold 6 tons. We travel in 3rd class railway cars. Compartment just holds 1 squad. Off to "somewhere in England". Houses of poor along RR track, all neat. Red brick and red tiled roofs. Children have wonderful complexions, red cheeks. Women, red noses. Only old men and small boys to be seen. They wave to us and cheer from backyards. Boys go wild at sight of women and girls, also taverns and beer advertisements. Out in country, evergreens, flowers of every description in spite of cold, damp chill. It has stopped raining. Old trees, great stretches of farms all under cultivation, pretty lanes, fine rustic bridges, mostly sheep grazing, few cows, many quiet streams. Railroad sidings full of loaded coal cars, soft coal. A number of collieries and large factories on line. Stop at station. Cannot buy candy. Another hour to next station. Most beautiful country in the world. Not a single frame house to be seen. Stop for tea served by girls. Steal around to back entrance of refreshment house. Come up with officers. Slink away. Back in cars again. Steam is turned on. Dark now. We are hungry. Share a few cans of beef and some bread which with some water from our canteens makes our supper. Settle back to read. Boys nap. When they awake there is singing and shouting. Nothing can be seen outside. There are very few lights. At twelve we pass through London. Make one stop and go on. Have another meal. Continue reading while boys sleep. High spirits all gone. Make themselves as comfortable as possible in little space. At 2:00 I stop reading, take a little nap. Awakened by guard shouting "everybody out. On platform look about. Not a thing to be seen except outline of what seems to be a large factory against a high cliff. Ask guard where we are. Surprised at his answer. Check of company taken in whispers. Follow an English officer into town where we cannot see 2 feet ahead of us. Houses only dim outlines. March for 10 minutes, then halt and retrace road. Ordered to converse in whispers only, to show no cigarette lights. Masts of ships visible in harbor. Search lights play in sky. Stop in front of large warehouse and go up iron stairs to outside building to top floor. A perilous climb in the dark. A big loft with a few men along walls asleep. Formed for bunk space and left to make the best of it. Nobody thinks of sleep for an hour or more. Lie down with all clothes on, pack for my pillow. Men in barracks are all wounded. Home on leave. One gassed tells his experiences. We awakened him. A pitiful sight.

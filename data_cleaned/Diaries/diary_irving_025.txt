Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 26 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Friday April 26, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good, left leg sore Up at 6:00. Reveille. There is a mist hanging low. It is damp and cold. Not a sound from the front. It seems as though a great battle has been fought and won and the men are taking a well deserved rest. Not an aeroplane to be seen or heard. We go up for breakfast. Bread, butter, coffee. Leg sore without a sign of blister or callous, just above knee. Feel it most when marching, Have an hour to myself. Get out a book to read. Formation with slicker. A nasty drizzle which makes for naught work I have put in cleaning and polishing my gun. We take a different road, less travelled. Pass a German prisoners camp, fenced about on all sides with an intricate network of barbed wire. Apparently untenanted. One Englishman in sight. Accommodations there are better than those we have, which is remarked by boys with one accord. Push further on to an open field. Stop on road for setting up exercises. Stack guns which we cover with slickers. Proves ineffectual protection against drizzle. Pieces are dripping wet. In fields we do skirmish drill for half an hour. It is time to return. Rain stops, sun comes out. A pleasant walk back. Foot and leg slightly better. Dismissed and formed for mess. Steak, potato, bread, soup. Our first good meal. Look for an opportunity to mail letters. Only way is to ask British to get them through. I will not trust mine to them. Formation immediately after mess. Captain in command. Go down main road through village and onto high road. Entire battalion is out. Looks as though something of importance is to be done. Halt just beyond town. Go down into hollow where English have constructed a miniature battlefield, with trenches and a miniature village on the hillside. Three companies group around area. English lieutenant explains purpose of our coming and calls a squad of men to give an exhibition of quick loading. Men work in pairs, one loads and unloads. Other man fills clips. Next an exhibition of aiming at men in trenches who show their heads for periods of 4 seconds. One man aims, another behind him verifies results of supposed fire. All shots declared hits. Then 3 details proceed to fire at targets in village. 4 men at a time. Their aim is excellent. Designated targets usually demolished by first shot fired. Our general comes up. Introduced to Lieut. and leaves. English method of physical training shown. They are in the form of games. Nothing is done in cadence. Men who are slow are penalized by extra work. we move across road nearer town when an advance of men from trenches is demonstrated. We cannot see very well or understand. It is more for the benefit of our officers who pay strict attention. They assemble for explanation after manoeuvers. It is past time for dismissal. I am very hungry. We expect to go right back to billets, but Captain takes opportunity to drill us in close order on a fine field. A company of unwilling workers. Led off field and drill is continued on road all the way back. I could eat a brick. Supper soon after dismissal. No retreat. Mess. Cheese, bread, jam, coffee. Generous portions given. I am still hungry. Write under shed behind barn until 8. Then to the village to buy some chocolate and change a big bill. Get enough to last for three days. Lie under a tree in field behind barn until darkness is complete. Go to bed. Cannot find diary. A big loss to me because it contains Leah's pictures. Valuable alone for the amount of work I have put into it. Make an ineffectual search for it in the hay, outside under tree, and in my pockets. Give it up and fall asleep. A mouse running around in hay near our heads. Men move and I look for it without success. Runs over their faces. Frightened and disgusted they pull blankets over their heads. Mouse comes into my corner. I beat about in the straw but cannot chase the visitor. Do as others did and fall asleep again. Not disturbed after that. Dream of home. Awakening a disappointment. Anxious about Leah and Cecelia. Can forget only by staying with men and singing. Impatient for letters from home. See two French poilus. Given an ovation by our men. Impressed with the discipline of the British so1diers. His manual entirely different from ours. Everything done in mechanical. Great credit due to non-com instructing.

Text: Tuesday April 16, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Fair, Warm, sea calm Health: cold slightly better, Head hurts over eyes and nose from congestion and cold. At Sea, In Danger Zone. A medical Examination. Up at 6:00. Reveille. Remain on deck for smoke. Cloudy but very warm. Sea is much calmer than any lake I ever saw. Remarkably glassy surface. Two land birds fly across our bows. Flying fish numerous and a shark or porpoise was sighted. Wash and make bunk. Feeling miserable. Cannot blow my nose without great pain and must breathe through my mouth. Go on sick report, a thing I should have done sooner. Wait in stuffy passageway for half an hour which is mighty disagreeable. Must go to hatch for air. Before turn comes we must go up on deck for boat drill. I have been transferred from boat 1C to 2A, Lt. Stevens. Assigned to ropes, if boats are lowered. All boats have been lowered to stations and made ready for instant casting off. Dismissed. Back to Hospital for treatment. Wait and read. Doctor calls for me. Prescribes 2 CC pills, 6 quinine pills and Argerol drops in nose. I get some relief at once. Breathing easier but pain does not subside. Read until 11 when I mount guard in boat 2A until 1 oclock. I am cold and in my present state of health it is foolhardy for me to stand in open boat, exposed as I am. Interesting work though, which makes risk worth while taking. I scan horizon on all sides as systematically as I can but see nothing but flying fishes and porpoises. Odd bits of rubbish at times which are suspicious looking. A lecture downstairs in hatch to all Co. E. men. Relieved promptly at 1. Look about for something hot for dinner. Miss 1st and 2nd sittings. Get in for 3rd. Have a plate of hot soup and some beans, tapioca pudding and potatoes. There is meat which is rejected by everyone. I lie down in my bunk and am hot with fever or perhaps from quinine. As much annoyed with myself for being sick today. Afraid something will happen while I am below that I am anxious to witness. Decide that I must get well promptly. Everybody below for drill call. When we go up, I find that sun is shining. It is warm and I decide to stay on deck. I go below and get my book and lie over hatch on deck until time for mess, reading. My nose is entirely free from mucous now and my headache is gone, and things are much more cheerful. Supper. Cheese, pickles, bread, butter, marmalade, tea. Everybody grabs as much as possible. Result, some boys without food. Upstairs. Great excitement. Smoke on horizon. It is convoy, we think. Cruiser signals. Ship becomes visible and proves to be a merchantman. Cruiser makes prettiest dashes and turns to approach and identify. Interest in cruiser's movements until dark. Chat with boys. Piscara, a Staten Islander in our company. Downstairs to read for an hour. Go on guard again 9-11. Nothing but gray sky, black water, phosphorescent waves, ships, black hulks of ships. One shows a green light at times. Cold and windy. Manage to find shelter in boat. Well bundled up. It rains for 5 minutes or so. Time passes rapidly. Near end of my shift, Lieut. Stevens comes into the boat and we have a chat, in which I forget he is an officer and become quite informal. Relieved at 11. Seized with a stomach cramp just as soon as I get into hold. Fortunate it does not occur in boat. Write, read. To bed at 12:30, In clothes. Sleep well. Chat with Lieut. recalls home to me very vividly and I dream of Leah and Cecelia and New York and shop all night.

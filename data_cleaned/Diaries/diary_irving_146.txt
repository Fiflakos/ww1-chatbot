Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 10 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Wed. Jul. 10, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Warm Health: Poor Up at 8:00. Cook for new detachment, obligingly gives me breakfast. I have no appetite. Refuse Bacon. Take only bread, which I toast, and coffee. Men who were out in the night are back. Gillece squeezes into my bed for a nap just before I get up. At 5, Lt. Griffiths calls Ellbogen to ask him for his report. Scolds him for not having turned it in sooner. I am glad to see him back, but he makes no mention of what I am to do. I ask him while he has his breakfast in kitchen. He has not yet spoken to K Co. Captain. He will do so shortly. I embarrass him every time I mention anything about the trouble in which we are both involved. I realize now that it is he, more than anyone else, I am doing penance for. That being the case, I must not again threaten to demand a court martial, which it is obvious would result in more punishment for him than he has already undergone. And since it is for him I am making the sacrifice of my vacation, I have much less to complain about. I regard him very highly and am certain that I will have an easy time of it through his intercession. Upstairs in the parlor we chat, 2nd Batt. boys telling the new men of their experiences, and giving whatever advice they can for their benefit. At 10:00, my comrades are ready to leave - without me. No word from Lt. and I am again despondent. Try to forget my troubles by reading Torchy, humorous, refreshing tales. Finish the book. All but a few of the new men go out on duty. They all have previously designated tasks to perform. They seem to be better organized than we were. No one has called for me to go to work, at which I am pleased and a little surprised. From one of the men, I hear that my Lt. has not yet gone. He was seen in the trenches escorting a party of officers from the relief. This morning my situation reminds me of the Englishman, whom we fed at ......... I am not attached to any organization. My meals will be given by men who are not expected to feed me. It strikes me as interesting to tell Leah of the Englishman and how my case parallels his. I begin writing her a long letter, telling the story of the supposed spy first, and then recounting my present experiences. Have dinner at 12. Only toast and a small piece of roast beef and a cup of coffee. Enough for my appetite. Afterward, when I have resumed writing, I am surprised by a call from Lt. He has finally had an audience with the Capt. and it is arranged that I remain behind and report daily to him, but 213work to be done by me, if any, will not he in conjunction with prisoners. I am assured I will not be considered as such. Capt. will use me for minor jobs to he done around hdqrs. Advised to take it as easy as possible. I only remain here for mess and my bunk, with the consent of the Lt. I would like to repay them by doing gas guard duty for them, but Lt. advises that that is not necessary. I thank him and assure him that present plans meet with my hearty approval. He promises to have mail for me, if any, forwarded without delay as soon as he gets back to his detachment. I thank him. He appears grateful that I will let matter rest as it is. Leaves as soon as I see Sgt. Stewart in charge, in absence of his Lt. I tell him that my status has been decided upon and explain details to him. Offer to do guard duty. Declines with thanks. Only returning favors we showed him, he declares, while he was visiting. Write until I become tired. Settle myself for a nap. Flies bother me. Must cover my head with coat and am awakened by the boys to go down for supper. Bread and coffee again. It is a fine diet. Frenchmen below us vacate. They are relieved to go back for a rest. I write till dark. One of the boys has received a bundle of papers from home. Brooklyn Standard Union and the American. Some copies of the Post. Sit at the table after the candles are lit and read them. Interesting. Almost as good as a trip home to read them. Pick up a copy of the Post. Strike a story which was the last I remember reading before I left for Camp Upton, dated December 1st. Read a story by George Weston. Look over war pictures in a Sun Pictorial Section. Chat with boys about the mistakes their predecessors and ours have made, They are interested. Some of their men are out on patrol. It is raining quite hard and the night is blacker than pitch. They have no raincoats with them. Sympathize with them. For their first night's work they must cope with rain, while we had ideal weather the entire length of our stay. We were fortunate. The ice of formality has been broken. I am no longer considered a stranger, and I am feeling considerably improved in health. I am quite content with the world. Nevertheless before I go to bed a reaction has set in and I have vague feeling of uneasiness, as if something detrimental to my interests was impending. It may be a bilious trick played upon me by my still disordered stomach. To bed at 10 o'clock. The Hun has sent over a few of his shells today from reports the men bring in. A few of them have been seen in the trenches from the OP opposite 12, where Thurn always saw something of interest he is supposed to have wanted to have seen. This minniewafer(?). His aeroplanes have been scouting overhead all day. It causes me considerable worry when they are up, because there is at all times a large gathering around the kitchen, none of them seeking cover when they should. They, I was afraid, would be spotted by Fritz and dispersed in a manner not to their liking. From behind our lines one or two guns have been busy without a stop today, sending shells in the direction of ......... and ......... The new men are anxious on that account. It seems to them they come in our direction from the enemy. During the night, the guard below is busy challenging men. The patrol comes back with lots of food for discussion. They have had the same trouble finding Germans that we always had. Like us, too, they are intent on exterminating themselves. One of them is lost in the dark and when he returns, one of his own men hurls a bomb at him, because in his excitement, he cannot give the password when challenged. And only a few hours before they had smiled tolerantly when I told them of similar incidents in our battalion. Everybody is awakened by the recital of their troubles and discomforts. Propaganda shot over to the German lines by French and Americans.

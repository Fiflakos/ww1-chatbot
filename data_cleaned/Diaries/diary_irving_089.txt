Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 13 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. May 13, 1918 Weather: Raining, Cloudy, Mild Health: Good Up at 2:45. Everything dark outside. Stars have disappeared as if by magic and instead is a gray cloudy sky. Damp and chill. Madam is already awake as I go for breakfast. So dark along road I cannot see ahead of me. I say another prayer for a safe journey and kiss Leah's picture on road, no one near. Line of men waiting for breakfast is long. Almost last on line. In spite of strict injunction against showing lights, men are smoking on line. There I hear stories of air raid which seriously frightened a lot of our men. Candles are burning in our open air kitchen to give cooks enough light to distribute food. Run short of bacon which holds up rationing. Bacon, bread and coffee. Men are afraid that during the day we will not be very well fed, so many attempts are made to procure seconds. Cause of heated discussions between Mess Sgts. and men. Trailer to cooker is already boxed on top to secure supplies. Rations for the day are issued. A tin of beef, a tin of sugar and tea, and as many small hardtack crackers as one wishes to take. I get my hat filled. Given a linen bag for food. Handy for toilet articles later. Eat some of my biscuits to fill up. Get my things together. Madam has two glasses of milk for each of us. Ordered to fall in fully equipped for marching. A package of letters from Leah almost forgotten. Dispose of them in my overcoat pocket. Trouble with my cartridge belt. Men are leaving without me. Get aid of last man to put on my pack. Start off, bid Madam a sorrowful goodbye. Pack improperly adjusted. Have become somewhat attached to old barn. Think of probability of going to a worse place. Unconsciously feel for packet of letters, when a good distance up the road. Lost. Will go back at any cost for them. Find in barnyard, dropped while putting on pack. Start off again at a run. Played out before I start on hike. Last to arrive at formation of company. Nothing said. Off quickly without a fuss at 5:15. Daylight broke at Mess. A brisk pace is set. I cannot catch my breath. Belt too tight. Once out of village we take a strange road. Wonder where we are going. Open my belt. Feel more comfortable. Two men fall out. Lieut. warns Capt. pace is too fast. Company halted, closed up. Start again, slower pace. Trouble again. One man throws away a pair of shoes to lighten his burden. Not in our company though. Find we are heading for main road along which we first came to billets. Going again to RR station at ......... . A great short cut. On road is heavy artillery and limbers are going up the line. Fall out for 10 minutes. Continue making cuts. Soon at railhead. Fall out again. Stung by nettles. Made station 45 minutes ahead of schedule in spite of slow walking. Surprised that my foot has not bothered me at all. Much excitement. Many officials, Colonels, Generals, etc. Crowded 40 in a car. No seats. Some of our men ride on flat car with kitchen. A can of crackers open in corner of car. Help ourselves. Warned not to take any. Warning disregarded. Start slowly. Men tired, lie down on dirty floor or on each other. Quickly becomes a stinking mess, animal like. It begins to rain. Only open door must be shut. Think of men on flat car. Hungry ones begin to eat. Little food about. Pass through farmlands, miles and miles under cultivation. Not many streams. Camps everywhere. Airplanes, tanks, ammunition dumps, coolies, English, no Frenchmen. Large manufacturing towns, water mills, canals, raceway. Only one large town seen. Every village, a church. Pass through .......... . At ........ Camp what seems like a latticed fence. Look closer, sickened by sight of little wooden crosses so close together that at first I was deceived. Some two thousand. Hot water at station. Make tea. Canteen donates crackers. Pull, out leaving 4 men behind. Arrive at end of journey, 7:30. Disembark. Wait in rain for half an hour, getting wet in spite of slicker. Men who were on flat car a sight for pity, I am comfortable. Start along road to ......... . Surprised to find so near to war. Walk along road lined with empty trucks stored for night. Why do they not take us? Signs along road forbid smoking. Rest for five minutes. Men smoke. Dark now, still raining. Across country road. Nothing to be seen. Silence and darkness. Follow blindly. Pass English Camp, barracks along a tree bordered road. Into darkness again for an hour. Rest, smoke. Dangerous. No one prevents. I am feeling faint, exception a little lost, drink water, regret it immediately. Off again. Through village. Angry we do not stop. After an hour men become so fatigued and disgusted they shout aloud for a rest. No attention paid to them. Flashes and boom of cannon across open field. Men drop back. I have difficulty going up hill but stick it out. Men shout, curse and swear, to no avail. Fall out. Fear for them in wet and dark. Finally reach billets. One man faints. I am so tired that I bend over gasping for breath. For first time men are encouraged by a word of cheer from officers. Not very far. Soon be in bed. Wake up farm to be billeted. Ours a crazy dirty barn with three tiers of bunks, only wire for bedding. Vermin infested. Crazy house. Off clothes. Slink into middle tier. Lie there until men are somewhat settled Use overcoat for covering. Too tired to unroll pack. Cold as death. Tired but cannot sleep. Everybody tossing, groaning, moaning, singing hysterically in slumber. Afraid I will become sick, though much revived. A madman, owner of the place stops men from picking up wood for fire in shed to dry clothes and warn themselves. Some stay up. They cannot find a bunk in dark. Pig sties occupied. A hell hole. My first hard knock as a soldier. Leah has given me strength through God. I had intended to take my horseshoe with me. Left behind in hurried exit. Cpl. Childs has "Rid-mosect" with him. Tons of tins along road.

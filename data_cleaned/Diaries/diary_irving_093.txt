Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 17 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. May 17, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Third platoon for police duty. Pick up a few papers and tin cans to be put on dump. Brush up gun. Loaf for a half hour. I would like to do something, but neither water nor pail are available. Out to meet members of SOS class. A short distance down road, front rank remains on road, rear rank goes into the woods. We have each a pair of field glasses. An exercise is arranged to have men on road do little things from under cover of a hedge, move about cautiously, etc., which must be observed by man watching through glasses from woods and vice versa. Very interesting. I am on road class. Our cover is a hedge, but background is a poor one. It is all open. Little growth behind. Our movements can be distinctly noted. Other class in woods has an excellent background to work against, with little cover in front. They are most effectively hidden. It is most difficult to discern their movements. As proved later when notes are compared, they noted down most of what we did, while nearly all their movements escaped our notice. Major comes up while we are sitting on road, Rather annoyed that we do not stand up at attention, until he is informed of the reason. Our company is shooting at a miniature range on other side of the road, in a hollow where horses come to water. Noise of first shots causes them to shy and stampede. We go from there further along the road into field where we were yesterday. Given a lecture, a practical lesson on finding an object while blindfolded, going by sense of direction only. I am best in class, almost reaching man standing quietly in the middle of the field, whom it is our duty to find. The same thing is gone through in patrols of 6 men each from the kneeling position. Not so good at that. It is very hot. We have our blouses off. Drinking much water. Men have neglected to fill their bottles, borrow from each other. Soon all gone. A race among us, divided into two teams, to see which section can get gas masks on in shortest time. Company across road with OD shirts off doing bayonet work. They are hot. Back for mess. Mutton boiled, sauce, potato, bread, coffee. Write. Report for afternoon work at 1:30. We all go into woods and are told how to sketch positions. From where class was in morning we make a sketch of stretch of road where we were behind hedge. Do a good job. Finish ahead of others. Praised by Lieut. with a few exceptions. Asked If I would like to take up signalling. I am not anxious. An exercise which trains in art of coming up behind a man without being heard. One man in center blindfolded. We all advance upon him from a distance of 8 yds, try to touch him. Successful 2 out of 3. Notes on shooting with and care of our new rifle read to us by Lieut. Back at 4 by a new course. Very warm by the time we reach barn. Retreat soon after upon return. Supper. Belly beef, hard tack, rice and raisins. A letter from Lottie in which there are a few lines from Papa, first he has ever written to me. Write under a tree in field until 8:30. Shave to prepare for possible inspection in morning. Walk around looking for lemon candy to quench thirst. I have been drinking water all day. Listen to a few groups of men talking about Fritz. Sit down on tree stump and join in a discussion about politics back home. An English scout plane showing lights flying overhead. Soon a Fritz machine is heard. Hovers about for a while. A battle begins, outcome not known. Three big bombs are dropped at one point. They shake the earth, rock barn, wake sleeping men. I jump up to see if I can make out anything going on above. It is too dark to see. Anti-air guns are trained on him from everywhere. Firing from streets and all vantage points with portable guns. A disturbance created for an hour. Appear to have driven enemy back. He returns judging from sound of renewed shelling in air. Townspeople frightened. Out of doors, gesticulating and talking. Our men in barnyard making too much noise to suit men in barn trying to sleep. A wordy war between the two factions. Silence and we all go to bed. For the rest of the night aeroplanes patrol in the air. Firing continues at intervals. Affair impresses me more as a Fourth of July celebration than anything else. I am anxious to see it from point where damage was done for effect it would have on me. Similarly unmoved in afternoon while sketching. Company firing from behind road which we are sketching, also our practicing on range in woods. Officers fear for our safety. Afraid we will be hit by stray shots. Rattle of bullets sound in our ears while we go on with our work, paying no attention to noise. We are perhaps under conditions nearer to being under fire than ever before. Badly bitten by insects in woods. Matches remain very scarce. We have permission in afternoon to go out without blouses. Also remove ammunition from belt to lighten load. Keep twenty rounds in case of emergency. Not noticed by Lieut. Severe punishment, penalty if caught.

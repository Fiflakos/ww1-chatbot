Author: Frederick Harold Tubb. Location: Hotel Roma. Date: Monday 28.06.1915. Nationality: Australian. I slept at the Hotel Roma just behindthe Majestic- reported to ColJohnston at 9.30 & found thatno boat was going to day.Received orders to report againat 9.30 tomorrow. I saw LtConnolley at Mustapha &found out that Lt Heighwaywas going home to Australiaon the "Ballarat" to day. Heardthat Col Bolton's C.O. of the 8th Bnwas joining the boat at Suezand going home also. Drew4 from Paymaster & got myteeth seen too. Met Lt Boltonat the Base record office (atthe Metropole) & went with him and Lt Weeks down tothe wharf- quay 73 where wefound the Ballarat. I wentaboard and met Heighwaywe had a great yarn. hetold me that he would go &see my folk at St Helena afterhe got home, I gave him mydiary (original) to take homefor me, & a box of cigarettes forFather. I was very pleasedto see Heighway & to have thechance of sending messages byhim. Capt Bannister wasgoing home also, & I saw afew of the 7th boys also. Thereare 600 Australians going -I believe Major [[Blizard?]] & othersare going by a later boat(?)I was interested in readingthe B.O. from the front.

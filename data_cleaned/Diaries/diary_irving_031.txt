Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 January 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. Jan. 14, 1918 Weather: cold, clear Health: good Up at 6:00. Disturbed all night by lights being turned on by Corp. of guard looking for guard. Make a general clean-up. Breakfast, poorest since arrival. Bread and jam, coffee. Sam brings me a package and a letter from Louis. We go out for a long hike to Smiths Field, where we are drilled by platoons and squad and in company. Work keeps us warm. Out until 11:30. Our platoon not in running in competition. Back to quarters at 12:00. Package from Leah. Dinner, roast beef, potatoes, peas, soup, coffee. A very short rest. In firebreak for arming and posture exercises and physical drills. With Sgt. McWhinney to warehouse for loads of supplies. He tells me that we may move by Feb. 15. I do not believe. New mess kits issued. Write, read. Supper. Bean and meat stew, prunes, tea. Sam tells me that he too has heard that we go away next month, from authoritative source. I am suddenly worried. Later he informs me that about 50% of men go south next week. Read and take a nap. Telephone Leah. Anxiety about her relieved. Afraid she would detect my worried mannerism, but no. Back to barracks. Sam tells me again men were told by lectures, that the next two weeks would probably see us all away from here. I had forgotten to ask him about my affidavit. Go to Hugh Murray and ask a great many questions of everybody about what was said. Sweaters, mittens, mufflers, gloves issued. Write Mama. Read in Hall. Have a little more conferences. Go to bed at 10:30 and have animated dreams of Leah and home while awake and presently fall asleep. Get a good nights rest. A day of many rumors from many sources.

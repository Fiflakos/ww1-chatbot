Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 11 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Jun. 11, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. We have stopped at a station where there are pumps and running water to permit us to wash and shave. Coffee served from our cookers. Both doors and windows of car opened to air interior. Men are somewhat sobered up this morning. In new country. Field and forest. Thinly inhabited. Some grain. Wild poppies, cherries, strawberries. New construction work going on all along route. American rails, farming implements and track machinery. Breakfast. Jam and bread, hard tack. German prisoners working on roads. Seem well fed and contented. Algerians, Moroccans in working gangs. Different rock formations. No more chalk and pebbles. Hard gray stone and lava strata. Not an Englishman to be seen. All French. Plenty of water. Streams all bridged. No grade crossings. Viaducts of recent construction. Birch forests. Yoked oxen replace horses on farms. Hay mowing tine. Every man, woman or child who can wield a rake or swing a scythe is out working in the fields. Soldiers home on furlough, and in billets doing their share too. Hills steeper but cultivated nevertheless. Small vineyards. At stops boys get out for water and wine. Men are left behind. Officers forbid us to leave cars except at coffee stops for this reason. Two of our men are missing. F Co. is four short. One of their men falls from car. Sgt. picks him up in his arms and attempts to put him on rapidly moving train. Cannot get him into box car or throw him on flat car, and both are left behind. A regiment of Algerians. At a crossing one of their bands plays for us as we go by. Regiment of Poles. Frenchmen moving back to billets. Large factories. Cloudy for a few hours and cold enough to wrap myself in blanket. Tired as are rest of the men, but I must stay awake to view scenery. Scribble a postcard to Leah and attempt to mail it. No one will take it from me. Dinner. Bully beef, hard tack and coffee from our cookers. Traveling through a cut most of the time now and an occasional short tunnel. Few villages along the road. A coffee stop at 1:15. Rum and coffee. Do not take any. Train split into two parts and sidetracked for a half hour. I look for wild strawberries which were plentiful along road till now. Find none. Men manage to get a few bottles of wine from children. Some cheese, of which I have some, white, bitter and strong. French soldiers having coffee and rum are selling rum to our men. They are filling canteens and cups as officers leave to superintend forward movement. Train leaves as Lenehan has two cups of rum filled. He must run with both hands full and is spilling the precious stuff so he drinks a cupful as if it were water. Facilitates movement and he can now make train. Five minutes later he is writhing in pain on the floor of his car and becomes unconscious. Two canteens full in our car. One swig and a man goes to sleep for an hour, all afternoon. Hills and mountains. More streams than ever seen when not riding through cuts or tunnels. Take a nap after rolling my pack as per orders to be ready to disembark about 10 PM. American men and camps. We are shouting all the time. What beautiful valleys and hillsides. Supper. Veal loaf, bread and hardtack. American boys greet us. Lined up on embankment. At dusk pull into .........., where American Red Cross workers give us writing paper and tomato bouillon. Gun carriages, cars, engines marked USA for which there is a rousing cheer. Stay at door until it is dark. A bright golden crescent of moon resting on a black cloud shelf, which gradually hides the lower point until it looks like the top of a golden shell, which slowly, very slowly disappears behind the cloud. So I lie down dreaming of peace. A hard corner near door. I shut my eyes but cannot sleep. One door still open through which I see the roof of ........, where we stop, while lying on my back. Twelve o'clock and not yet at journey's end. At ........., Wall, who has taken too much rum, starts a rumpus with a little Italian in jest, which awakens us all. We are hungry and think of the rations we have saved. Candle lit and we have a midnight supper of hard tack and bully beef. All settled again for a nap. I collect some straw for a pillow, smoke a cigarette and fall asleep. Camps and soldiers along railroad and in towns we pass only evidences of war to remind me that I am not touring the country. I try as much as possible to take an interest in what I see. It is not hard to forget war amid such scenes, in the afternoon particularly. Would like very much to have a map of France. Maloy has been up all day. He is much better. A dozen drunks.

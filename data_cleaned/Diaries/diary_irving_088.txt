Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 12 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. May 12, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Cold Health: Good Concert by band for all Battalion Up at 6:45. Breakfast. Oatmeal, bread, butter, coffee. Raining as usual on Sunday. Clear for a while. Begin day's work by removing clothing from Barrack Bag, taking out what I need for pack. Go out in field to work. Barn crowded. All working space taken up by other men. Fold blankets. Get all tobacco and toilet articles I have in bag between first and second blankets, so as not to be seen if inspection is held. Disposition of all my things almost decided when Lieut. comes with order to take out suit of underwear, one blanket and OD shirt. Cans and OD shirt to be taken away. Blanket and underwear to be rolled up small in separate bundle and labeled with name of owner and organization. Take out things as ordered except for shirt. Leave that in pack. It begins to rain, which stops proceedings until I can find a dry spot to work in. Clears again. Finish rolling pack. Quite heavy. Barrack bag ready to be turned in. Ordered to fall in with packs. Question arises whether coats or slickers are to be worn. Conflicting orders. Finally decided neither. Arrive for formation after company has been dismissed. A good laugh. Have a little time to write. Read what I wrote to Leah yesterday. Decide to tear it up, start anew. Cans taken away. Write until 11:30. I am tired, take a nap. Do not hear mess call blow. No one awakens me. Up with a start to find barn empty. Look at my watch. Just in time to make it. Hurry, for I am hungry. Dinner. Boiled beef, potato, bread, coffee. Meat too tough to eat. Formation announced at which blouse, dress shoes, campaign hat will be turned in to Supply Sgt. after which men will form again to sign the payroll. I go up. Sgt. McWhinney asks if I must report to Batt. Hdqrs. I understand him to say I am wanted there, so I make haste to report to the Sgt. Major. He does not know who wants me. Go back for explanation. I have misunderstood. Look at payroll sheet on table. Ask Lieut. why it must be signed again. Answer is as I expected. Data in remarks column unsatisfactory. Paymaster will not OK. Haight later attempts to convince me that fault was mine. I cannot resent inference. He is a Corporal. Some day, perhaps, I will let him know his place. Sign payroll. Note that all remarks contained therein have been worded anew but not quite up to what paymaster requests. Haight is a very lazy man. An hour to myself in which to finish my letter to Leah. Another formation to draw ammunition. 100 rounds each, not 200 as originally announced. Barrack bag and blanket rolls turned in taking up another good hour of our time. German planes sighted high up. Anti-aircraft guns try for them, unsuccessfully. Our move formation announced for 5 o'clock. Write a letter to Mama. Retreat at which first Lieut. commanding in Captain's absence sets a new fashion in doing parade rest. He has his hands behind his back until it is brought to his attention by titters of boys and fellow officers. Takes it quite good-naturedly. Supper. Cheese, bread, apple, jelly, coffee. Chill canteen. Company advised to do so by Lieut. Word is passed around that it is best to sleep fully clothed. We leave very early in the morning. Finish writing. Mail my letters. Find that field kitchen is being made ready for shipment with company. Think for a time that means we will walk entire journey, camp out at night, cook in field. It has grown very cold, damp, chill. I write outside until I grow cold and darkness gathering, I decide to go to bed. No blankets at all. One is in pack, another in blanket roll, third in barrack bag. Spread my slicker on straw, put on my overcoat, go outside to finish a pipe. See an OD blanket which no one claims. Take it for my own use. Lie down. Wait for Reilly to come back from next village. I have asked him to bring me some cake. Kronenberg comes in with some figs of which he gives me a generous handful. Reilly brings back some biscuits. Share them with the boys. Talk for a while. Cover ourselves with the single blanket. Try to sleep. It is too cold and damp. My feet are like ice. Toes numb, My body is warm, almost perspiring. Toss about restlessly. Manage to snatch a few winks at intervals. A rat disturbs my slumbers too. Runs around and scratches. Somewhere near our heads. Not a sound heard of firing all day, except by our own men nearby, but around 12 midnight a few scattered rumblings are heard. I have occasion to go outside not long thereafter. See flashes of light on the horizon to the South. A sight unfamiliar to me in these parts was a cloudless sky with myriads of stars. Discern a few shooting stars. Booming continues for an hour. Little intensity. I cannot fall asleep again for more than an hour, which I spend in dreams and picturing Leah at home, wishing that I were with her or she here with me, wondering what she and baby are doing. I say a fervent prayer to God to take good care of them for me and of me for them. Manage to get an hour's solid sleep, apparently, for I did not hear an air raid, heavy, in which bombs were dropped which woke most of the men and shook our barn. Anti-air gun and searchlight get busy, making more noise. I do not hear a thing (No air activity worthy of note). During the day I had three glasses of milk. I have given Madame a bottle of camphorated oil which I cannot take with me. Other boys make all kinds of presents to her. She regrets that we leave.

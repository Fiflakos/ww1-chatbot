Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 5 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Aug. 5, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. The bugle wakes me. It blows reveille. Something I have not heard for months. The companies have formation in the 261streets. I wake the other men, dress and go downstairs to look for the kitchen. It is a long walk from where we are, uphill. There is stewed apples, Karo, bread, coffee made from chlorinated water. Water is scarce in this town, because it is on the crest of the hill. In the center of the town is a well which supplies six troughs, some for washing, some for the animals to drink from. The town has two streets, one long one and one short one at right angles to it in the center of town, like a T. It is filthy dirty, animals of all kinds run about the streets, quite a well populated place. Old men and women are plentiful. Two stores, which supply all needs, a few drinking places, a large church and a school, which was formerly a poor house. At breakfast Gillece tells me there is an empty bunk in his billet, so I decide to change my quarters. Gather my things together in a shelter half and take them across the street. Then wash at the troughs where hundreds of men have already washed. They are using the animal troughs, too, which makes the water unfit to drink. To my billet. Go behind the house to see what is there. Orchards full of plums and patches of garden truck, many potatoes, peas and beans. look for plums which can be eaten. Blue sugar plums are not ripe, but I find yellow Mirabelle plums which are small but good. There are many varieties on hundreds of trees. Also apples, pears, nuts. Meet Maloy out looking for plums, too. He tells me that Conway has found some red ones, ripe and sweet. I follow him, chewing those I have till I find Conway. His tree has wonderfully sweet, red and gold plums. There are others like it nearby. We eat so many of them that I am afraid I will get sick. My belly is so full that it is doubtful if I can eat dimer. I leave the boys and trying to get back to my billets, I lose my way. I had no idea I had wandered so far away from the village. Look across the valley and the cultivated slope of the mountain, a which is surely a "belle view". Meet a little, aged, bowed woman, who is looking for some kind of herb among the potatoes. I speak to her. Ask her questions about the town and surrounding country. She tells me the mountain is an extinct volcano, which has erupted in her youth. She calls the picture before us a belle view. All around on the slope are the simple graves of men who have died for France. She tells me about the German invasion. Talks with difficulty, being bothered with asthma. I am kneeling, while I listen and talk, looking up into her face which is almost level with mine, she is so small. I can see the church spires of many towns in the distance. I ask the old lady if one can look into Germany from the summit of the mountain, but she does not understand. I believe it is possible to see Germany. Bid Grandmother good-bye and go to my billet, get hay for my bunk and arrange it for to-night. We do not march again until further orders are issued, so it is expedient to make myself comfortable. My drawers are dry at last, which gives me much comfort. I plan to write a letter to Leah to-day. It is a long time since I have written to Mama too. First I will clean my gun. It is very rusty in all parts from the rain of Saturday night. All the men are cleaning theirs, which gives the Sergeant an idea that he will hold an inspection at 4 o'clock. The Lieut. has ordered a formation at ?? o'clock for some unknown purpose. The division commander has issued an order that men wear belt, rifles, and full equipment in the streets when men are away from billets. No one can understand why, we are so far away from the lines. I am seen without my belt by a lieutenant and am asked why I have none. I give him a satisfactory excuse. Going to dinner, I carry my belt like the rest of the men. We have steak and potatoes, bread, tomato sauce, coffee. Feed the chickens with the leavings. They gobble up everything that drops. It is unnecessary to police. After dinner, 262write for half an hour, and then fall in for formation. We go back of the house into the orchard. The Lieutenant comes with Sgt. Frachi, who gives us a lesson in signaling to aeroplanes with panels. There are only six to learn. The signal kit consists of l triangular and 2 rectangular pieces of white muslin. The Lt. explains how aeroplanes send signals to men below and the Sgt. shows how to answer. Then the Lt. begins to talk about guns, that they should be thoroughly cleaned to be ready for use probably in the next sector we take over. He thinks it will be further north, where there is open fighting more than trench work. This indicates that in his opinion we will go to Chateau Thierry. Tells us how to shoot and sight the new Springfield rifles, which some of the snipers have. Most of us are bored and want to be dismissed, but some of the lads who have nothing else to do, ask a lot of questions, which prolongs the session. When finally we are dismissed, I go with Rubin, who has been in the infirmary below our billet and has wandered out in back to pick plums. He is too sick to eat any, but I lead him about with me for an hour while I pick plums, eat and talk to him. I learn some things from him about the engagement we were in on the night of the 3rd and 4th of July. His action and that of the Captains. Back at 4 in my billet, where I write until supper time, which we are informed is at 6. When we get to the kitchen, there is nobody on line and it looks to me as if the company has already messed. I ask some men whom I meet. There is nothing left for us but Sgt. Kessler is a good fellow. He has some bacon fried for us, which with some bread and coffee makes my supper. He promises better for breakfast to-morrow, and will give us tobacco in the morning too. The scouts are laughed at for being late. The men tell us that we will be late going over the top. After supper the men borrow as much as they can get together to buy beer with. They all go out to get drunk if the money goes far enough, leaving me alone with Streetor and Simpson. I lie on my belly in someone else's bunk and write. Interrupted occasionally to answer a question, which the boys ask. We get to talking about letters and writing, what the censor will pass and what he will not. I tell them of some of the things I have written home. It is growing too dark to see, so I go to my own bunk in the bedroom, light a candle and continue writing. Streetor, Mac and Swanson come in to go to bed. We get to talking of many things. First job is what finishes the night's entertainment, which started with a discussion of the war. They go to sleep and I write until my candle goes out. Make my bed and go to bed at 11. Sleep well in a fairly soft bed. Shortly after I go to bed, I hear a noise of some kind downstairs, which makes me think of war. Which is all that has happened to suggest there is such a thing. No shells, rifles, or bombs heard, nor are there any aeroplanes up. Strange as it may seem, since there is no money among us, the boys get drunk. They pledge their next month's pay for drink. Come in about 10 o'clock and say things that are nasty to listen to, but for which they are not responsible. I hate the army when it is resting. The same old story of idleness breeding mischief. No place is it so true as in the army. The Captain has been supplying funds for some of the men, in small sums. The best thing that has ever happened is that the men will not be paid until after we have finished our movement. I need the money but will gladly do without it so that the boys will not kill themselves on the hike, by drink. The infirmary is busy at sick call. All farm machinery in the country about here is American made. McCormick patents.

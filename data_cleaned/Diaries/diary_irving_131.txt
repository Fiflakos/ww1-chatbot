Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 25 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Jun. 25, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Three blasts of the whistle. It cannot be 6 o'clock so soon. I had only just gone to sleep. Everybody up. I rub my eyes. I am not dreaming. Do I hear the cry Gas? I was sure I heard it coming from the next barracks. It was expected I know, so just to make sure, I reach for my mask. No need to put it on, in six seconds. We are indoors. I wait to make sure, because it is inconvenient to wear mask. 1st Sgt. exclaims at this point. Everybody up, roll packs, ready to move in a few minutes. Going up the line. We are needed. Message to Batt. Hdqrs. Too bad that my hopes are shattered. If I must be in a trench on Thursday in obedience to orders, I must. No help for it. I will kiss Leah's picture, say a prayer for her safety and that I may come back to her. I feel easy and quite calm now. I find myself pitying Rubin, who always wants to know what time it is in New York. It is only 1:30 now. Sure enough, "It's about 7:30 in New York". That is all. We dress. I carefully adjust my new leggings as though I am going on a vacation trip or an 184outing. Make up my pack, adjusting everything neatly. Lt. C. comes in to hurry us. Slickers will be worn. He sees everybody rolling pack. Asks why. "We were all told to". "No, No." Only 1st and 4th platoons and Del Duca's squad, of the second, Bezer's squad of the 4th. A relief for those men who do not go, that is given vent to in a vast audible sigh. They help us to get ready. Outside it is dark, a bright moon and a starry sky. My first care is water. I tell all men in squad to fill bottles. We must wait to draw ammunition. Order is to fall out. No lights to be shown. Fifty cigarettes are lit. Rubin examines his gas mask, a good idea. I do likewise, while I listen to Reddie next to me asking Sgt. where we are going and how long we would stay, in a voice subdued by fear. I want to go away from them. I would rather listen to shells bursting. Auto-rifle ammunition is drawn, pistol and rifle ammunition comes up next and we are off, just as day is dawning. March up the road in squads, twenty yards apart, slowly, so as not to gain on leaders, through the virgin forest, silent, but for the waking birds. It is hot work, going up hill always. Co. single file on right of the road. I lead. Order passed back to halt and rest. We close up and sit down. We must get up again. Close up platoon. Rest. Up a 45 degree hill, a terrible strain on the legs. Sweat pours from under my tin hat in little rivulets. I pant from the effort of that little climb as though I had run miles. Rest for a few minutes. Lt. puts SOS and a few more good riflemen at the head of the column. We go on till edge of woods. Look down into the valley where there is a low hanging mist, which we think may be gas. One can never tell. We sniff! Must wait again for some reason, which angers Capt. Not so us. Smoke and picture our fates, in fact, we can hear over the hills the "Put, put, put" of a machine gun, else all is quiet. Push forward again, cautiously, for we are in an open field. Fritz is up. We cannot hide. A little village. There is a barn being used as an ammunition dump. Two oxen are on guard. They eye us suspiciously while we sit on shells and powder boxes. Forward! Shells, shells on all sides in camouflaged dugouts, pyramids on roads. And a little hillock, which as we come closer proves to be wire and painted canvas, loose leaves and straw. Under it a gun. Into the trench go the leaders. Stay there while we push on, some left behind in every bay. 308th to end of sector. Captain goes on to establish communications with unit on our left. Order is to keep a man on guard, not specific what he is to look for. Other 9 men to get under cover, in a clump of scrub pine and hemlock in the hollow. We are wet and hungry. A strawberry patch just outside our door. Forget fatigue and hunger and work for pleasure of picking berries. The dew on ground is like ice. My fingers grow numb but I do not stop until my cup is half full. Lie down to rest until my turn comes to stand guard. No one knows where to get breakfast, which worries us. Runner comes up at 9 to tell us breakfast is ready, also that we must go back 200 yards into woods and keep under cover. Most interest in breakfast. In a clump of trees, 200 yds. away, it is being served. Cold because it is brought to us from a distance of almost 3 miles. Stewed figs, rice, biscuit, coffee. Go back and carry out orders to move. Go a little way off road into the forest, and all lie down for a nap. My helmet is my pillow. Fritz sends over a shell. It lands not far from us. Wakes us, causing a little worry. Wait for a few more. Decide they do not endanger us. Lie down to nap again till noon mess. Do not sleep soundly of course, and we hear shells in the air and sounds of our own artillery at our right. No mess until 3 o'clock. Steak, onions, potato, biscuit, coffee, cold. Nothing to do but loaf and sleep if we can. Batteries near at hand open fire. Two are not more than 100 feet from our little camp. They 185startle us. Concussion rocks the ground. The noise is not a boom but more like the clanging of an iron door, many times magnified. For a half hour, they pound away, Fritz returning our compliments. Quiet. Visit Frenchmen working on big gun. They prepare to move it. I carry on a conversation with them, which is more to my credit than any hitherto, thanks to yesterday's study. I remain behind, while men go for supper. They bring back bacon, potato, coffee, biscuit, cold, greasy. I try to start a fire to warm coffee a bit, succeeding in warming it just a little. Men prepare beds and pitch tents. I wait, reluctant to undo my pack. Stroll about woods, where I see OPC gun emplacements, dumps, dugouts, trench systems. French infantrymen's camp. When I come back, a voices calling for corporal. I suspect an order to move. I am right. All men's labor gathering twigs and straw gone for naught. We must go back to position occupied in the morning, taking up post held on arrival. Our blankets are taken into pines. We stand guard with respirators at alert, tin hats on, guns loaded and locked. Wait an hour not knowing what to do, all watching. 1st Sgt. comes up with instructions. One man to watch, others to lie or sit in trench. Can smoke if we wish but must not show lights. It is awfully cold sitting on parapet or in trench. The moon pops up over distant hill and before I can call Rubin's attention to the brightness and beauty, it is half over the top. It is a full moon, shedding a light as bright as day. Flares go up. Signals for our artillery. Flashes returned from under their camouflaged hillocks. Soon they will begin their work. Reagan comes to tell us the signal for gas is 3 shots from a rifle. If the men to our left or the right send it, we must lose no time to get our masks on. We must be on the alert for shells dropping in our zone. Blankets are brought up from below. We lie down, two men abreast across width of trench, after an hour spent in smoking, jesting, chatting and complaining of the cold. Rubin remains on guard. Shut my eyes, which is a signal for batteries all around us to open fire. First one fires as many shells as possible, then taken up by the next and so on. A flash, a crash, a puff of smoke, a sound of some irresistible unseen force hurtling though the air with a rush, a whistle and a moan, as it goes to its destination, which is too far from us to hear sound of explosion. We humans, become accustomed to all things. Being tired, growing warmer from close contact with Gillece, my sleeping partner, I fall asleep. I hear nothing more. "Gas", frenzied shout, which I do not stop to question or think, nor does anyone else. I grope in the dark for my mask, which I have kept on. Hold my breath till it is uncomfortable, before it is adjusted. Rubin fires signal, second shot simultaneous with the bang of our big guns. I hear the hiss of escaping gas, and of bursting shells, and peer through goggles into the haze, all in an instant. In a minute, the hiss and thud and haze are gone. I look into the clear moon, quiet reigns. We look at each other, gather courage to talk cautiously and then Rubin's excited voice is heard asking pardon. He made a mistake it appears. There is no gas. But, he is sure he heard shots, which made him aware that his responsibility for men's lives rested upon his shoulders, and his imagination did the rest. I listen to his apologies, nervously uttered, until I would like to tell him to shut up, were he not such a keen young fellow. Look at my watch. It is just 1:30. My time to go on guard. I suggest it was only a little joke of his to wake me up that way. He is too excited to see the humour and makes further apologies. I take over post. A runner is sent to find out cause of signal being fired below. He returns, saying that it came from headquarters to them, and the sound of a distant barrage, only thing to disturb silence of night, while I am on post. An aeroplane is up. Do not know his mission. 186At 2:30, I wake Lukas and take his blanket and place in the trench. Rubin took mine next to Gillece, where he fell asleep instantly. Sleep like a brick on the damp cold earth of trench.

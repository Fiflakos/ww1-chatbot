In mid-May 1918 the Divisional infantry was reduced to a training cadre, and used for training American troops. Many reduced units were attached for short periods at this time. It was reconstituted as a full first-line Division late in June 1918. 3 No. 9 was a pill containing a laxative. 4 Drug introduced in 1887 as an analgesic.

The Maj. Geer? in Grovers diary seems to be William Wells Greer M.D. who practiced medicine in Edinburgh after the war. He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1914 and earned a Military Cross during his military service. 3 Here is some information submitted by Jim Strawbridge to the Great War Forum: Ackimzey notes the bombing of 3 Can. Stat. Hospital in which mention is made of four doctors, four nurses and 17 others killed. A source that I found notes three nurses and two doctors having been killed the nurses being Dorothy Mary Yarwood Baldwin, Agnes MacPherson and Eden Lyal Pringle (all Canadian Army Nursing Service). I assume the fourth to be Gladys Mary Maud Wake who died three days later from serious leg injuries.

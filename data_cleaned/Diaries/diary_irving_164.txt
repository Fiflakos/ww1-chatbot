Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 28 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Jul. 28, 1918 Weather: Raining, Cold Health: Good Up at 7:00. I might have slept on, for there is no breakfast. There is only bread, syrup, coffee, but the bread is green molded, unfit to eat; therefore the syrup is useless. My breakfast consists of a cup of coffee. I wash and shave. The boys have received some mail and are reading it. I give to each man what I have bought for him and they are all pleased. 245One of the men, who came in during the night, comes in to ask if we have a vacant bunk for him. Deys can accommodate him. He comes in with his stuff and tells us all he knows about France and the trip across. They travelled differently in every respect than we. I take the boots up to the Lieutenant in the rain, thinking surely he is awake. Enter his room, which is empty. Look into his bedroom and see a little bundle under a blanket, which I judge is he, and go back, slipping and sliding down the hill in the mud. It is cold as the early winter and bleak with prospects for an all day rain. Make an attempt to write which is interrupted by a vicious itching. The cooties in my shirt are moving about restlessly, probably looking for a warm spot. I decide to read my shirt. Go to the door for the purpose and with the aid of Streetor, I find a plentiful assortment of sizes, breeds and degrees of plumpness in "cooties" nests and breeding places. There will probably be more to-morrow. It is about time I had a change of underwear and a bath. To the Lieutenant's shack again. He is not in, and after waiting a minute, I hear his footsteps on the boards outside. Bid him good morning and tell him he is unfortunate and cannot get his uniform until Thursday, unless he goes to Nancy for it. As usual, he takes bad news quite calmly. Glad he has his boots, at any rate. Give him his money and ask him to give me the 13 Frs. I spent for his boots. He tells me he knows I have had no pay this month and insists that I permit him to lend me money. Having in mind the many small debts I owe, I think it best to take 20 Frs. from him and pay the small debts I owe. Thank him and leave for the billet to straighten up my accounts again. Lie down for a nap of an hour, which proves refreshing in spite of the cold. My feet are like ice. It is chill and cold. Necessary to resort to the use of blankets for warmth. When I awake, I write until time for mess, which is better than I expected. The story goes that there will be little to eat for a few days, on account of new prisoners we have taken at Chateau Thierry, whom it is necessary to feed, taking away supplies from the entire division. We have fine boiled beef, tender and aplenty, with peas and bread of which I manage to get a piece that is not moldy, and coffee. After dinner, there being no formation, I lie in my bunk to write. My eyes are tired and it is with difficulty that I finish the page. Then I take another nap of an hour. Resume writing. Maloy, Gillece and others have gone to company headquarters. Ask for mail and candy if they can get any. Wait anxiously for their return. A long time since I have had any candy. While I slept, I had a dream that I was home and was talking to Papa, who was sure that peace would be declared by September the first. Very realistic. Hope it comes to pass. Am annoyed again by Schlesinger, who wants me to revise his poetry. It is in worse shape now than before. Make a suggestion to him, which if he follows, may improve his work. Stops raining, but the ground is very muddy and it is still cold. I must go outside often. Begin a letter to Leah. It strikes me that I have been negligent in not writing to her all week and I am duly repentant, promising myself that I will write her a long letter. Supper comes. Expecting to get nothing at all to eat, or next to nothing. I am surprised to find bean and beef stew, doughnuts and coffee. I get two more doughnuts and then more from Ellenbogen, so on the whole, I have made up amply for the ration I missed at breakfast. Resume writing. To-morrow we will receive no ration at all. We will have to eat our iron rations and for that purpose we must turn in our bully beef for cooks to make stew of. Our men turn in their stuff and are told to give it in to the sergeant of the kitchen where they eat. Rather than do that they keep it and eat it before going to bed. I have a piece of bully from Schlesinger's can. Doherty comes back 246from ........, in the dark of the forest, duplicating the feat I accomplished yesterday. He says it is not worth while taking the trip for a bar or two of chocolate. Ask for Gillece. He is somewhere in the woods with Tallon. I remember I have given him five francs and I think, therefore, that perhaps he is drunk. Doherty also tells me there is mail for us being brought in by Joe Maloy. I remain awake, writing until he comes in, which is not very long. He brings with him a bulky envelope from Lottie and three letters from Leah, but still no pictures of Cecilie. I wonder why, but in one of Leah's letters, it is explained that the pictures are not ready yet, and in another Leah tells me that she has sent on a pipe and Cecilie's picture with another of Rachel's friends who is coming to do canteen work. A great disappointment, for I have no hope of ever receiving them through that medium, having in mind the package that was sent to me like that, which I should have had not long after May 30th. Sorry it is too late to get Leah to change her plans. A letter would not reach her for a month and it is probably too late to wire her, for a month and six days at least would have expired since she wrote of her intentions. I know that Leah has received my bouquet of flowers, which I sent to her through Rachel, who acted like a Major and never told Leah a word of what I had done until the day arrived. Leah cries for joy, which I am glad to hear. She writes me a wonderful letter about the happy day she spent and the presents and telephone calls she received from her friends. In Lottie's letter there is the same good news, Thank God, and pictures of Hattie, Lena, Bella, Vincent and our dog Nellie. I did not know how good it would feel to see the "mutt" and that it would be possible to feel the home ties tugging at the sight of a dog. I show the boys pictures of my pretty sisters, bless them. They are pronounced pretty by everybody. Read and look over some of the letters that Leah sent me since I have been in France and they appeal to me more than they did when I first read them. I haven't the heart to burn them, as my intention was and I decide to hang on to them as long as I can and carry as many of them with me when we move as I can. My gas mask is already loaded to the brim with letters. Today I am not aware of having heard a single rifle or big gun fired. No aeroplanes up owing to the weather. A very quiet day. Rumours of our next move remain as they were, with Chateau Thierry and Italy still favored. Capt. Mills' funeral held in ........ today at 2 PM with the Major, a lieutenant and eight non-coms in attendance. I am annoyed at the rain today, more on that account than any other. I was hoping the sun would shine for him. Go to sleep amid noise as usual. Joke telling continues. In spite of having read my shirt this morning, I scratch all night. Tallon grits his teeth a lot to-night. Gillece and he come back without candy after I have gone to bed. They have run into two Frenchmen who belong to our camp. They are drunk. One of them has a pint with him. Gillece and Tallon have a funny story to tell of their experiences. They meet Hessler and others looking for spies.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 19 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Jul. 19, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Fair 1st Batt. - no casualties Up at 7:00. Awakened by Corp. McGovern who wants us to report to officers' mess. For a moment I think the scandal I am involved in has been straightened out, but it only proves that he has no orders as to my day's work, other than what I have been doing. I do as he bids, making no attempt to argue about it. Report to the kitchen. Everything is already cleaned up though it is only 7:30. Get my breakfast there. Bacon and potatoes. My mind is much easier over the new state of affairs this morning. I am not worried and go about inquiring how Regt. Hdqrs. knows that I had an easy job and just what it was. I find that Ludwig, Co L clerk, had been in the habit of filling out a daily report in which my name was mentioned as being at the officers' mess. I believe that was questioned, since officers' mess could get along without extra men. I wash and do a few chores, sweeping up, carrying wood, etc., after which Corp. McGovern decides that it is best not to have me in the kitchen. He tells me to fall in with the others and report up the hill. There will not be much work to do, I am assured. We take our time getting there and find a tree trunk to sit on, while on the way. Next, we go farther up hill to where the platoons are camped in the wood and there get to work, digging a latrine. It is easy work. There are 4 of us. 2 work at a time, 1 loosens earth with a pick, one shovels out loose dirt. In that manner each man works about 15 minutes of each hour. But in spite of the fact that it is not so bad as I thought, this is no business and no place for Leah's husband and Cecilie's papa. One aeroplane up over us in wood. One tree, 2 1/2 feet thick, split 15 feet above the ground by a shell, cut off completely by a great force. At eleven o'clock, we decide that the latrine is finished and make our way back home by the open road and in close formation in full view of observation balloon. A grave error. Rest in a round house dugout, probably of German construction. I try to write a letter but it will not work. There isnt a thought in my head. I am right to refuse to be in the company of these men. Hairbrained, thoughtless, silly laughter. No wonder I cannot think. At 11:30, we are on our way back. Go direct to quarters. When I arrive upstairs, I notice that the flowers which I have pressed and been saving to send to Leah are on the floor, as if my personal belongings have been trifled with and gone through. I suspect Smith of the trick, but say nothing. I will watch. Eat my mess. Steak, lots of peas, bread, coffee. Corporal tells us to report to Rgtl. Hdqrs. at 3:30, with packs. I am interested in the order, chiefly because I see an afternoon off. I write a letter to Mama. The boys make their packs. I do not. Orders come to remain where we are. No packs will be taken. Start a letter to Leah. Aeroplane is up, a Boche, not far away. A gun opens up almost directly behind us, which we mistake for shelling from Fritz. At the first shot, I spring up, see that I have my writing and all my pictures, gas mask and helmet and make for the dugout. Outside I discover my mistake and go right back again for I have no time to lose. One soon tires of his diversion. At 3:30, we prepare to assemble. McGovern meets us and arranges us in formation to take us up to be turned over. We have appeared without belts and rifles and are sent back to get same. In making the change, I forget my gas mask, a loss I am not aware of until I am halfway to quarters. No men we are, and the corporal takes us through the streets in full view of the enemy's observation balloon, in addition to the mistake he makes, permitting us to go about unarmed. He expects 229to meet the general and sure enough he does. We are called to attention as we are marched up the road to headquarters. General stops us and demands an explanation from the corporal. He has his orders from the Capt. and as a final result, by six o'clock, we hear the Captain has been relieved of his command, the Corporal punished. We fall out in the road and for a whole hour we wait for Capt. of B Co. to turn up to take us over. He does not come. Finally, we are sent back to return at 7. I go first in staggered formation. I hurry. So far I have been exceedingly fortunate. Get back after having been out for 1 hour and 15 minutes without a gas mask in very dangerous country. A fine way of safeguarding Leah's and Cecilie's bread earner. I am most ashamed of my neglect. I made plans to get into the tall tree, that had a ladder against its boughs, in case of a gas attack. I would have been safe if I could get there. Get my mess kit and prepare to go to supper, when Bernard tells me I will be out of luck if I go to kitchen. There is no more left he tells me. I do not care. There is bread downstairs and that will do me. He has jam and we find a can of hash out of which we make our supper. Artillery shakes us up a bit while we eat. An argument about the location. I am getting anxious to know what will be done with me. Write until seven o'clock. Men who play the piano very well come to visit and entertain. The table is cleared and taken outside the hall, so there is room for dancing. Quite a parlor these men have fixed up for themselves. Lounges, upholstered cushion armchairs, piano, etc., pictures on the wall, the best beds in the town, cooking utensils and stove. A home. Man plays ragtime music wonderfully well, sings some of his own compositions. Another does likewise. An exceptional pair. Oh how I love to sit upstairs to listen so that I can imagine I am back in New York at someone's house where there is entertainment. I wonder how it is that life in the trenches does not rob men of both the desire and the ability to play. Ponder on the effect that spirit, which cannot be subdued, has upon men who are fighting. Think they are leaders without a peer. They can make an army sing itself to victory. I write upstairs until it is too dark to see. Go downstairs in parlor, a place I would have avoided ordinarily, but since I want to finish my letter to Leah, I must give up my preference to necessity. There is a good deal of noise. The players of course, have left, to go back with their companies. The relief is beginning to come in. At ten, Corp. McGovern brings a great big Simon Legree and a new corporal to whom we must bow for the term of their stay. The information is given us that we must get up at 4 o'clock in the morning. We will do the work done by ration details of other companies. Lots of thinking and suggestions for getting out of it, none of which proves of any value. Write till 11 o'clock. Boys are making doughnuts and coffee. I have some before I go to bed. Get into bed and fall asleep quickly. About 2 o'clock, for some reason, my bed collapses, making quite a little noise. I am not in the least frightened. It strikes me as funny knowing guard who is awake would be frightened because it comes from upstairs. Sure enough, they came up with loaded guns and rifles while I am fixing it. Sleep well.

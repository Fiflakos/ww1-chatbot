Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 19 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. Jun. 19, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00 . Stiff and sore. Do not care to go to breakfast. Not very hungry. Bacon, bread, coffee. Sit around. Look place over. Many buildings housing our men and officers. Fine husky lads everywhere. Group of our men around lads who have been up line. I wash, brush up, make bed. Go for a stroll into town. I have a notion I would like some fruit in spite of prices. Most men in company have spent all their money in ......... . They come to me to borrow. I do a thriving business as a money lender. Into the town as workers from the factories are going to lunch. Shops of all kinds. Soldiers line streets, fill cafes and restaurants, street corner groups, a crowd around commissary where tobacco, cigarettes and canned goods is sold. Newspaper and fruit stands surrounded. Streets littered with orange peels and other refuse. One cannot be at ease, there are so many officers to salute. Attracted by a display of laces, socks and handkerchiefs in a shop window. Suggests itself that I might send something home to Leah and baby. I follow main street to end of town to gas works and factories, which are at work on war supplies. A slight shower comes up. I see fishermen along river bank from road. I stop, lean over wall and spend a few minutes wishing that I were once again on Jamaica Bay in a boat with Leah and the boys. The fishing season opened officially, in France, yesterday which explains why, till now, I have seen no one angling. Am tempted to go back and question them, look around for road or incline. Find none. Go on. Buy a newspaper. Drag my feet along. I am very, very tired, more so than yesterday. An effort to get back to barracks. Breathe heavily, walk heavily, think heavily. Way seems twice as long. It takes an age to make the short distance. I have taken no interest in anything I have seen. Spoken to no one I could avoid. Out one hour and I am completely in. Throw myself down on my straw mat, look over newspaper and in a few minutes I am asleep. Flies walk all over me making it impossible to sleep soundly. Wake at 3. Wash for dinner, which will be served at 4. I am feeling much refreshed but am extremely blue and irritable. Walk about grounds and buildings, in hallways of which are maps and inscriptions chronicling deeds of army leaders and dates of their successes, coats of arms, etc. Nothing of an artistic or interesting nature to be seen. Everybody is plain, ordinary, commonplace. No decorations whatever. Supper. Beef stew, bread, coffee. Upstairs to write at a table, a novelty since leaving camp. Disturbed for a time until men leave, their beds made up. One bed is on table. Captain has announced there will be movies from 6 to 8 at the YMCA. Everybody leaves for town. I am left quite alone to finish my task. I do not know what to do next. I am not sure but what movies night appeal to me. I do not know where they are so I will go to town and wander about aimlessly. If I find cinema, I will go in. In square, I am led to look again at shelled section of town. Cross bridge to get there. Loiter to watch fishermen once more. Told to move on because bridge is mined. View the ruins. See a YMCA down the street. I go in to have a cup of lukewarm chocolate and crackers. Cinema other side of the square. I will go in. It is free. Inside are Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, street urchins. Our Captain and officers. Seats narrow and cramped for leg room. Wait 15 minutes for picture to be shown. "The Ragged Earl", an old American film, I learn from man next to me. Five reels. First one is interesting enough, so is second, then my eyes tire. I shut them and see myself in the Richmond or Park Theater with Leah. The Strand and Rialto in New York another scene in my mind. I become indescribably melancholy and homesick. Stay on because if I go back to quarters I will feel worse. Here there is something to compel slight interest at least. Force my eyes to remain open and try my best to follow picture. An effective cure. Disappointed when lights go up at 8. Go out into square. Struck at once by the similarity sky bears to grey painted backgrounds used in photograph galleries, which I always thought too exaggerated. I am caught in a shower before I go 100 yds. Manage to get to RR station before downpour becomes too heavy. Sit on a box waiting for it to let up. Run out at first sign of abatement but am caught again midway between gate and station. Run as fast as my ambition permits and get under shelter in doorway. Wet through. Expect to find a candle lit in sleeping quarters so that I could make my bed. Men are all asleep. It is dark. Take off my shoes and make my bed and it is not long before I am asleep. At YMCA I heard a fine voice accompanied by piano. I ask question concerning procedure for mailing souvenirs and bulk articles should I have occasion to do so. Get a surprise while watching Frenchmen at mess to see that they receive an issue of red wine for supper. In questioning them, I believe I have accomplished a feat, being first conversation in French in which it was not necessary to draw pictures in air. Pleased with myself for that, the only achievement in a blue day. See a sign on building, Bathing, Washing, Delousing. Two Sergeants from Regulars assigned to our company.

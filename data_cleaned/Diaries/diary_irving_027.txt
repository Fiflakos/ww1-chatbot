Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 28 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sunday April 28, 1918 Weather: Damp, Chill Health: Good Up at 7:00. Very reluctantly. Big guns have disturbed my rest. It is raining. Barn is damp, too. Rain leaks in through gaps in the roof. Go up for breakfast, attired in slickers. Stand in line in pouring rain. Cap sheds rain. Drop from it falls down my neck. Cap without a brim is useless in wet weather. Get to gate. Food runs out. Must wait until fresh supply comes up. It rains harder than ever now. Canned salmon, butter, bread, coffee, to which I add an egg which I saved from yesterday. Bring mess back to barn to keep out of wet. Walk which I had planned to take is impossible. Roads are all mud. I remain in billet. Sit around chatting with men for half an hour. Some go to the ancient church to attend services. Those that remain lie down for a nap. I get back in my corner, cover myself with a blanket and take a nap. Awakened by Jones. He and I must each carry a barrack bag to orderly room for sergeants who are being sent to schools to receive instruction in British methods. Signaling, infantry drill, grenade throwing, machine gun fire. Two of our lieutenants go forward for study and observation. No sooner do we arrive at orderly room with bags when first sergeant informs us that no barracks bags can be taken along. We are to tell sergeants of that fact and go back with bags. I fill my pipe first and take my time about returning. Get a cup of hot coffee in the kitchen of the farmhouse as my reward. Not a tidy place. A queer stove of sheet iron which burns soft coal. Everything smells of and is full of soot. It has stopped raining, turned to fine drizzle. Sit in straw and take advantage of quiet to write. Time for dinner comes before I am aware of it. Boiled beef, potatoes, soup. Arrangements have been made to censor and post letters for us. They must first be signed by our officer, then go on to base censor. Back again to write a letter to Leah. Sit outside under woodshed. Letter I wrote last week I decide to tear up. It is too intimate a letter to be put through from our orderly room. Supper. Bully beef, cheese, bread, coffee. Continue writing until dark. Go to bed by candlelight. One of boys has a cake which he divides up among boys. Cake is a luxury which we have not had since leaving camp. I have not been out on roads except to go to mess, all day. The clamor of battle has been terrific all day long. Not a moment's cessation. The ground trembles as if in an earthquake. Constant rumbling as of thunder all day long, occasionally an extraordinarily loud clap as if a nearby town were being shelled. While I write the bombardment is so intense that my nerves are affected by it. I feel as though I would really like a drink of alcoholic liquor to steady them. Never before have I felt the need for stimulant. I wonder how men actually under fire can live amid the bursting shells and booming cannon. How can they live when in addition to the hardships of trench life, diet, lack of sleep, hunger, their nerves are wracked by that stupendous noise. Madam is worried. She walks about all day with tears almost welling out of her eyes, raising her hands in horror and telling us of her fears in language we cannot understand. Activity in the air is curtailed. A few planes sighted flying very low. After some good-natured chaffing while under the covers, I fall asleep to be awakened at 10:30. The ground is actually trembling. My ears being close to the earth, the rumble is more distinct than under ordinary circumstances. I cannot fall asleep again for a long time. Firing at its greatest intensity seems to come from German lines.

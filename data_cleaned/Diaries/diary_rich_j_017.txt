Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 19th October 1914. Nationality: Australian. Monday Oct 19th.The eventfull day has as lastarrived. The camp was astirat 5.30. with kits packed andhanded in by 7 am. A damnpoor breakfast and we were onthe road by 7.45. Tram carwere used from Charing Cross toFort Macquarie wherewere where wewere aboard the majestic looking"Euripides" by lights in very quicktime. We were put off intomesses of 20 men and there we satfor hours until the 3rd Infantrywere put aboard. All seemedis readiness to leave by at 2.p.m.but we are still at anchor at 4 o'clock There were but few people outthis morning as we passed along OxfordSt. Yet there were some stiring little incidents as we drove by. One aged man holding to a stout stick for support tried with as brave a heart as ever a soldier possessed to stand at attention. Another old warrior straightened himself by the aid of a veranda and xxx saluted. Lots of men & women waved a pleasant good-bye but it was only skin deep; No one nobody but ignorant persons could treate such a mission as we are about to undertake so lightly, and almost with frivolity. But the men who have seen service, were as the two above mentioned, full of sincerity and hope knowing that there was hard work for us to do and at the same time with doubt sorrow & sympathy laying beneath their hardened but thoughtful casings of their experienced bodies. I am no bubber; pain & distraction hardens and me, and drys my eyes to cold clearness, but warm affection & ^with ^a manly consciencious face upon it, fills my eyes with tears of joy and brotherly feeling that one is understood. This being missunderstood' is the greatest trouble I have noticed on this globe. Most people are so wrapped up in themselves that they forget even those nearest them until something serious happens and brings home these foolish idea that because they are alright everything and everybody as ^a I matter of course must be also. Many of the hundreds of boat loads of people that sailed around the "Euripides" to-day thought of nothing further or deeper than that a friend or brother was going to the war and as it was going a long voyage they came to wave to him (not the troops) a pleasant and safe return. The Coast Artillery with their brass band aboard the S.S. Miner went around about our vessel for 1 hours playing cheerfull tunes but just before leaving they struck up "Old Lang Sine", it seemed to come right from their hearts and it again dawned upon mye they themselves were warriors and know and understood the work ahead of us. They finally played "God sa Save the King" and I was fighting again to keep back the tears as we stood lined up at attention on the top deck. Many of our well-wishes waved flags and shouted franticaly, they were in earnest too, but it was a couple of people on the "Burra Bra" making for Manly that fills made water come to my eyes when they stood still and held a blue Australian flag outstretched. It was plain to me what was ment they were cold level headed persons, and seemed to say "keep your end up boys wherever your going to just for the honour and for the glory of your dear Australia and your love for the Mothercountry. It fairly thrilled b me through & through. It was one of those silent signals " full of meaning and respect. When some broken down insignificant craft came up close to us and "tooted" her good wishes on the shrill siren, it came from the right place under the coat. The rain in heavy showers intermingled with sunshine must have dampened & discouraged the folk who came down to the Quay and Farm Cove to see us away. Our boys are tired and sleepy as they have been up early in the morning and late to bed each night. Dinner was a bit topsy turvey, but is full of promise. There are 6 or 8 nurses on board, this afternoon I saw them on the promenade deck and amongst so much karki colour their sky blue dresses with a bright red cape cape & white hanging cap makes a pleasant change. This will be particularly noticable later on when the dungrees and browns get become an eyesore. Midst the hooting of whistles and the cheering of our boys we slowly steamed down the Harbour at 5.30 pm, but to our astonishment we put into Mossman's Bay and hung up for the night. There was a great scramble for bunks or hammocks at 6.15. They were hung very close together so much so, that when one man turned over he woke up the man next to him & set a whole line of them swinging. Yet the fellows seemed to favour sleeping in hammocks to the ground at Queens Park. I went to bed about 8 pm and up again at 6 a.m. Ships rations.

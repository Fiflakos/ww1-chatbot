Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 24 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wednesday April 24, 1918 Weather: Damp, Cold Health: Slight headache and footsore Up at 6:00. Very sore feet. Bathe them and change socks. Wash. Go up for reveille. Have a half hour till breakfast. Look about. There are pigs, chickens, horses, pigeons, cows, all running about at once. There are no young men in town. Lots of children and old folks who go to work in the fields. An aged cure and an old assistant. A church and a graveyard a hundred years old. A school in which our headquarters are established. Windmills furnish power. Two dozen or so houses of which 10 are estaminets. A store which sells canned goods and chocolate. Nothing much to be bought from farmers except eggs and milk. Everything else is strictly rationed. Wine and beer, of course, are plentiful. English soldiers are about, loafing but not a French Poilu in sight. Cannon booming in the distance. Noise so loud that the reverberation can be heard like the roll of thunder and the earth rocks. Aeroplanes are going up. We all slept well and refreshed ourselves with a bath under the old pump in the field. Breakfast. Beef stew, burned, bread, marmalade, coffee. The kitchen is moved to a more convenient spot, further still from us. I confess I am hungry. Boys immediately besiege Madame for eggs and mi1k. Eggs are 6, milk 3 our money. I have an opportunity to write. Start a letter to Leah. Walk through fields with Reilly. Look forward to a good rest and vacation. Consternation and cursing when order comes to fall out for drill formation. Object is to keep us from stiffening up entirely. I would rather rest but see justice of officers decision to drill us. My left foot hurts like the devil. We get a few lessons in how to handle our new rifle. Dismissed before mess which gives me time to shave. Dinner very late. Stew, bread and coffee. Mostly fat. Eat it all. I am hungry enough to eat leather. A scramble for food. Given an hour's rest, which I take up with writing. Our barracks bags have come up. Mine has been found in H company's quarters. It is in good condition. Some men's bags have either been wet or chewed by rats. Detailed to do a little fatigue job to get some scrap sheet iron from salvage warden. Go to village to buy some chocolate and sardines. Prices are ruinous. Estaminets are all filled with both English and American soldiers drinking. Boys are spending their money royally, forcing up price of liquors. Englishmen are playing string instruments in one place where they pass around hat to get enough for a few drinks. Back to quarters to write. I seat myself in a covered cart in the yard, where undisturbed, I can arouse myself to thought inspired by the melodious song of the birds. Supper. Cheese, jam, bread, coffee. It is almost dark before supper is served. I have helped bring in supplies from stores carrying a load of bread. Meet R..... who insists on taking a loaf. I become a partner to the crime, remembering I have sardines. An onion is stolen by Callahan, a bottle of champagne is brought by Reilly. We repair to quarters and by the light of a stolen candle we have a second repast which is more to our liking than the first one. Not very much enchanted with the taste of champagne. Take a little of it. Offer to pay my share of cost. I must write to Leah. I break up party which was held behind woodshed. Go to bed after writing only a few lines because I am hot from the wine I drank. A fight starts among men over candles. Corporal refuses to put his out. Boys are afraid light will be seen by aeroplanes. A noise in the courtyard just then frightens us all and helps convince the corporal of the necessity of putting out light. It is only a dog barking at one of our boys who comes in late, drunk and singing. Guns have been keeping up a terrible concentrated fire since sunset. The noise is constant and as near as I can judge, the firing is from our lines. It is all our way at any rate. I ponder a long time about the reason for it all and cannot find any. Nothing but destruction, killing of men who can never be replaced. People here have courage, become accustomed to cannonading. They seem to think nothing of it judging from manner in which they go about their business. Make an attempt to speak French with the women of the house. I really thought that I could carry on a conversation in French. That belief lasted only two or three minutes. My delusion is dispelled. I wish that I had brought with me a French dictionary.

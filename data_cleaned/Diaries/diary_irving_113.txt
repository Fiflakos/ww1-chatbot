Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 6 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thurs. Jun. 6, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good On hike. .... Kilometres to ........ . Up at 6:00. Appear at Reveille. Create quite a sensation. Must be directed to place in proper squad, because I have not been at formation since shift in platoon organization. CO announces that packs and blanket rolls will be made up according to list given out yesterday. No mention of time set to move. Breakfast. Rice and apricots of which more can be had, bread, coffee. Go about preparation for movement at once. Take down tent, make an inventory of belongings and a quick decision to disregard list for my own judgment. Put a lot of extras in squad roll. Make up pack with overcoat and slicker rolled on top. Slicker should be in pack, but I see no occasion for carrying it. A dry country. Order issued to go to Bombing Field at 9:00. Changed to have us assemble with packs in field. Take guns and gas masks. Remove all American gun slings. March to Field #1. Do a few company movements. Ordered to ground arms and forward march. How easy to get away with a dirty gun. Back, wait a few minutes. 1st Sgt. details me to take a money bag to Battalion Hdqrs. Same contains money with which to pay off company, an event occurring at 6:45. 63 1/2 Frs. collection debts due me. Report to Sgt. Major with bag. I should have given it to Sgt. Newton. He is at Field #1. Go there - not there. Back. Ask. He is eating lunch. Meet him coming out of his billets. Too busy to talk. He really has a lot to do to get ready for movement, which begins at 4 PM. Meet company going out with belts to dump bayonets and ammunition. Recalled to report for bombing. Field on road to baths, a few trenches, a place to throw from and another to throw into. A steep bank, running to the road, down which we go half way for protection from shrapnel. First 15 minutes, instruction in parts of the Mills Grenade, then we throw three bombs each until 12. After I throw, I am placed on guard for 10 or 15 minutes. Watch process of throwing and explosion from safe distance of 100 yds. A big column of earth domes up from the hole and for one minute after small stones and pellets of mud play tunes on hats of men. When I throw, I am a bit nervous. I do not throw very far. Back for dinner. Pork and beans, something the boys have not seen of for 2 months, bread, coffee. Final meal in town. Police up. Many formations for the purpose, but I am not in any of them. Unexpended portion of day's rations given out at which I help. Butter, bread, cheese, jam. Cigarettes and matches from the 308th Association. Formation to draw our own rifles and ammunition interrupts formation of our company at which iron rations are distributed. So some men do not get any. Help at issuing rifles. They are the self same rifles we left at ......... . Ammunition familiar looking too. Overcoats ordered removed from packs and put into blanket roll. Slicker in my case goes with it. Pack much lighter. Impossible burden as before. Our parting police formation and we are off we know not where. Turn corner and wait there for 3 quarters of an hour. Boys fill canteens. Some get beer or wine. Surprising. Officers permit it. They are at wits end, wondering where we go. Rest of Battalion comes up. We lead, and start South by West along an unfamiliar road. Still very hot. Choking dust. No breeze. Load of pack bothers me only a little. Fall out. Major and Sgt. Major let on that we have 30 miles to go to railroad head and have 3 days to do it in. Stunned to think that anyone has the nerve to ask me to hike for 3 days, a thing I would never think of doing on my own accord. Men drink copiously. Many borrow from me. I give grudgingly because they drink more than is good for them and again they are told time and time again to fill canteens before going on march. Winding down the road we attract the attention of an airman. He swoops low and flies over our heads to see who we are. See smoke from railroad station so disbelieve tale of hike. It is not possible that we walk where there is railroad. Meet up with 1st Battalion. Sweet is with them. H. Schneider too. Halt to let them pass by to take lead. Really an inspiring thing to see so many men trudging under heavy load, cheerful when it is most brave to be cheerful. Supply wagons, cookers, trailers, water carts, all the paraphernalia of war. Our battalion, as an organization a work worthy of praise, but still energy misdirected. When passing through villages, the men sing "Hail, Hail". The English must have no cause to doubt our courage. On road, unobserved, only a few songsters in action. Dust caking on clothes and clogging pores. Mucous from nose black. Feet beginning to burn. Blister on heel of right foot. On last march, leg muscles and joints stiffen. Passing through section where French are billeted. Interested in us. Stop at RR station. Expect to entrain. Cars pass by, gates open. We go on. Halt on other side. Fall out while officers arrange for billets. None to be had. Get permission to use a field. Seems made for purpose of tenting. Supper ready in an hour. Men scour town for eggs, bread, milk, chips, drink. Throw myself into tent. Paired with Upham, Sgt. Rest. Eat jam, bread, cheese. Feet hurt like the devil. Sweat is chilling. Only one blanket. Try to, heat tent with candlelight. Many lights shown. A big flare from kitchen grease burning. Attracts airmen who pass over us for defense. Get hot coffee. Feel better. Lie down to shiver alone in tent. Sgt. has taken his blanket to Kaplans tent. Glad to be alone to pray for courage to continue and for health of my wife and baby. Smoke for calming. Manage to sleep a bit in spite of cold, noise of brawling outside, and disgust at Upham's breach of manners. Restless and cold all night. We are evidently near to lines, judging from the sound. French tell us of shelling of nearby points by Fritz. Capt. pleased with day's work. He is non- communicative.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. May 14, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good At 10 o'clock call in courtyard that hot coffee is to be had. Captain wants every man in company to have some. Men too tired or too weak to get out of bunks for it. To me it is a godsend. I get out in a hurry. Get a steaming cup. A wonderful bracer. Warmth diffuses my body. Get back. Try to wake some of the men to go out for coffee. Some awake, all the while cannot be induced to get out. One man falls into hole. Coffee soon gone. 75 men have been piled into place. Body warm, feet cold, space small, knees cold, cramped. Wrap them in slicker. Slumber fitfully, wire sticks into me. Madman yells all night. Awake at 6 to find sun shining. Promise of a beautiful day. Get right out. Boys who have remained awake have made tea, as black as coal, strong as poison. A smoking fire by which I warm my feet. Boys report that no water is to be had in town except rain water. No pumps. They manage to buy eggs -70. Boil them in tea, fry then. I buy three. Give Reilly one. A pot of coffee sent up from kitchen. Captain comes along, looks at our billets, told of madman. Will not accept place. Looks for another. Breakfast announced for 9:30. Feeling fine and cheerful now. Surprised at myself. Clean gun. Sun shining brightly, warm as toast. Go out to look about town. Ascertain name of place. A hundred scattered houses. Rest of Battalion comes in including our stragglers, headed by a band of Scotch pipers, the most beautiful music, coming through the trees, that I have ever heard. A good thing to hear. Hear of a detail being wanted. Make ourselves scarce. Breakfast on time, a piece of bread, marmalade and more coffee. Throw some of it away for the first time while in France. Make up bunk, unroll pack, spread my things on grass to dry. Go to barn where our extra b1anket, which has come in, is being given out. Mine cannot be found. Go back. Lie on grass in a very hot sun, to write a letter to Leah or rather to Rachel, asking her to buy a bouquet of chrysanthemums for Leah on our wedding anniversary, June 27th. I have thought of this for a few days now. I may not be alive on that day and I want her to know that I thought of her. For her sake I ask God to spare me. Make six or seven starts, each time making a mistake. Start over and over. I will not give up. A new billet found for us, even better than last place at .......... . Get Reilly's assistance to move. Question of how to remit money comes up. I finish letter. Mess. Stew, lots of bread, coffee at 2:15. Think I will write a letter to Leah. Write only seven or eight lines when I am told mail is in for us. Being distributed. I go to orderly room, arrive as my name is called. Rubin has been collecting letters for me. He has a fistful, more coming, 12 in all. One from Lottie. Envy of everyone. Read them in field back of barn. Mess call. Continue reading on line and while I eat bully beef, bread, coffee. All the letters contain the best of news. Believe I have the best and bravest little wife in the whole world. She sends me a flower leaf from the bouquet I sent to her on the 6th of April. They came to her as I was leaving camp for parts unknown. Leah and the baby are in good health, bless them. Everybody has been so good and kind to them. I have a big debt to repay. Write under a tree while a cow munches the grass at my feet, until 8:00. Make inquiries of the Captain whom I meet on my way to the orderly room, how I could get money home. He does not know. Unusually good humor for him, we have a little chat about letters. Get my gas mask and go with Reilly to top of hill to see star shells being sent up by Fritz. The artillery is rattling away at a fearful rate. Nothing like it heard at our old billets and there were times when I thought it was bad there. Shells bursting in the air trying to bag German airplanes. They are heard distinctly but are hard to see. Told by sound of their motors, which do not sound as smooth as ours. Hundreds of airplanes up during the day on scout duty. In the evening there is machine gun firing in the air. Telegraph wires singing with messages going back and forth. Return to billets. Take a look around my barn for the first time. A clean, airy place. At both ends there are so many holes in plaster that walls look like trellis work. All barns in town are in same condition. Plaster jarred off by shock of explosions. Make my bunk with Reilly using overcoat as pillow. It is hard to sleep with so much noise. Men start a discussion about what is going on. Airplanes passing overhead also tend to keep men awake. Find my bed a hard one, not enough straw for bedding. It is Cold too. My side soon begins to pain from lying there. On this account, somewhat restless all night. Another reason, battle not diminishing in intensity until well into the morning hours. Our first full day in new billets passes with the impression that if so much is still being done in the war, peace is a long way off.

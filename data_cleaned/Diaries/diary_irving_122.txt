Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 16 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. Jun. 16, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. A rush for breakfast, which I avoid by staying in my tent to arrange things. Hard beans, Karo syrup, bread. I hardly finish eating, order comes to roll packs to go to rifle range. Rubin helps me, giving up what little time he has. Everything is just thrown together. A stiff jolt would knock it all apart. Company formed and off in a short time. Range a kilo from camp. 10 targets. I shoot in first relay of ten men. I make a very poor showing, at which Lt. wonders. Not so I. Whoever told him I was a good shot is mistaken. Range is an old quarry of brown sandstone. Lie prone on a shelf of stone, which lies in strata from 1 1/2 to 2 inches in thickness, just as if laid one atop the other by the hand of man. A considerable deposit. A cave. A high bank on three sides with shelving rock along the road which leads to it, more stone on the left. At the crossroads, I spread my slicker to lie down for a nap, while I wait for the other men to take their turn. Talk and smoke for an hour. Sleep for another. Awake to find our men running in and out of gateway of house to left of road. They have been in the gardens to pick flowers for their caps and have found the house unoccupied. I get on the scent immediately. In a sumptuously furnished room, an elaborate chandelier, cabinets, wonderfully carved furniture and woodwork, a desk, every drawer of which is filled with papers of military importance, scientific instruments, seals, books, engravings, works of art on paneled walls. A music room, conservatory, sun room, bedrooms in one of which a bed which was recently slept in, a calendar, showing date when last occupied, probably November 17. A cabinet, full of beautiful jewel cases, empty, but keys in all of them. On the calendar a little marble plaque, a work of exquisite art, dress clothes, shoes, etc. Perfume. Upstairs an attic, which is lighted by purple glow, giving the place an air of mystery. Armour room, guns, ammunition, a fully equipped chemists laboratory. A large reception hall. In the parlor a suite of costly cloth or gold embroidered upholstered furniture, an onyx table, a settle and a footstool, which I fancy for Leah and me. I want to roam for an hour. Boys play a phonograph. Some take bits of clothing or small articles for souvenirs. I take a visiting card found in the desk, probably that of the owner, for all seals and other things bear initials corresponding. A beautiful garden. All hastily abandoned not so long ago. Cobwebs over doors and shutters are of recent weaving. Call to fall in. I tear myself away and my imagination pictures the owner and his life, on the march back to tents. Dinner. Boiled beef, potato, tea. After dinner a formation to attend a lecture on First Aid and how and when to apply, at the regimental infirmary. The church chimes are playing. The village is in gala attire. Everyone going to church. Coming from all sides. Quite a walk. Wait for doctor. He leads us to spot in the woods, where there is a natural rostrum for him to lecture from. We sit around on the damp earth. It has been drizzling for the past half hour. Talk on First Aid in sickness. For aid to the injured a volunteer is wanted to strip. Doctor must mark out position of principal arteries and veins on him. No one volunteers. Kenny is drafted. Demurs. Commanded to obey by company officers. He is a nymph in the wild wood. Marked up with indelible pencil. Thanked and dismissed. Doctor selects me for purpose of a model to demonstrate methods of bandaging different parts of the body. Does me up all over. Uses a tourniquet to prevent my bleeding too profusely. Trusses up all my broken bones in arms and legs. I am a most interested patient. Calls for questions. A few asked. Dismissed. Back for supper. Make inquiries about my lost blanket roll. It is being traced. It rains, In spite of which men wait on long line for supper. I would rather not eat than do that. Come last but get plenty of good stew, bread and coffee. Go to pump to wash my mess kit, which reminds me to pick some cherries for dessert. Write till 8:30. Go for a walk to ........., where there is a factory I would like to see. I can see its chimneys from our town. It is dusk. Men coming back from ......... by automobile whose kindly drivers give them a lift. Some have bundles of delicacies for friends. Some are full of wine. Men still drinking in houses I pass. Find the object of my quest is a brick, tile and conduit factory. A large place, not being worked to capacity. I go no further into town. Must get back in time to make my bed and be present at check. Roll call. Rubin has unrolled my pack and is making bed alone. I help him, undress and go to bed. Talk for an hour about home. I hear from Sgt. that mail has come in. Asleep at 10:30. It rains hard during the night but our tent is dry. A guard posted around camp to permit no one to leave during period between dinner and time to go to lecture. In the evening we are paid a visit by French soldiers who speak Italian to members of our company. A demonstration and discussion on our and their methods of bayonet work. Street urchins and young arrive from village. In afternoon many of our men from nearby billets visit us. Signal corps, quartermasters and others. Bring us news of some men who were with us in camp in US, men that left us months ago. I reach the conclusion that what is left in France is a lot of cripples and simpletons. Hunchbacks are frequently seen on the roads. Out of 4 men who are in our camp tonight, 2 are misshapen. They are very lax in morals. Talk to our boys as if experienced and steeped in vice. Boys of 6 or 7 smoke cigarettes without discomfort - like veterans.

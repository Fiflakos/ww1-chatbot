Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 31 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Wed. Jul. 31, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. The first thing that is told us this morning is that two men have been struck by shrapnel from the bombs that were dropped in the night. Two horses were also injured. It appears that the Boche spied the lights of some engineers who were loading a transport above H Co. kitchen. Wade gets the news when he goes up to breakfast. A bomb was dropped very close to the men who were working. Gives rise to resentment among us and we decide that there will be no lights showing to-night. It is brought to the attention of the officers and the guard has orders to see that all lights are out at dark. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Wash, shave, hang out blankets to air, police, then pull off my shirt to hunt for cooties. In my OD shirt I find one big one, but my undershirt is full of cooties of all sizes. A surprise to me how we get them. Talk to the boys for a while before I begin to write. The rumor for the morning is that the 42nd, which we relieved, is digging trenches behind the lines. This comes through the medium of a letter one of the boys has received from a friend in the 69th. We are still accredited with 251being sent to any place from Alaska to China. My plans for the morning are to continue revising my story, which I will send to Leah. The men are preparing to go to the rifle range in the afternoon. They go to the YMCA for cardboard with which to make targets and a number of them mark bullseyes on them. I write all morning on my bunk without being disturbed by anyone. Dinner. Boiled beef, potatoes, soup, bread. Three planes up this morning directing artillery fire. They are seen through the trees. After dinner I have a feeling that I would like some exercise. The boys have been playing Cat considerably of late. Think I would like to join in a game, which at one time I played fairly well. Wade offers to play with me. He plays poorly. I have not lost my proficiency at the game. Play for ten minutes only when the Sgt. orders us to fall in to go to the rifle range. We protest against wearing blouses but as a few men have washed their OD shirts, MISSING PAGES and a few pieces of beef, bread and coffee. Resume writing, inside, then in the sun, then in the shade. The boys are tired of seeing me writing. They josh me unmercifully. Some of them become insulting. I have difficulty restraining my anger. Mitchell imitates a drunk to perfection, so natural that for a time I think he is drunk. Get some candles from F Co. kitchen and write by candlelight in my bunk until the officer of the day and the guards order all lights out. There are a few lights left in the woods after ours are out. I can see them from the door. The boys are boisterous. They are cheering the mess sergeant, the scouts and the runners, telling jokes and making a lot of aimless noise. There is a lull in the noise for a minute. It seems that we hear an aeroplane. It is only a wagon going down hill. The gaiety of the boys shows again. Another lull which seems to be final. Kelly begins again. We hear some kind of horn. It is quiet so that we can listen. Four revolver shots are heard in the woods. The merriment continues. Then the horn we heard before sounds again. It is surely a gas siren. Two shots from a rifle. The men yell gas. We get our masks ready for instant use. I adjust mine to alert. Somebody yells, "everybody out". He is scolded. Some of the men sleep, not hearing either the sirens or the noise of the men. A machine gun heard from the lines. Try to sleep with my mask on my chest. It is uncomfortable. After an hour, no further alarms having been sounded, I hang my mask on the wall again and try to fall asleep in spite of Tallon who is gnashing his teeth tonight more than ever. Everybody is beginning to complain about him now. He annoys me all night. I do not sleep for a half hour's stretch at a time, what with Tallon and the cooties.

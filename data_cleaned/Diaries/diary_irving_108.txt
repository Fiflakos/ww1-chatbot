Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 1 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. Jun. 1, 1918 Weather: Fine, warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Assemble for Reveille. Back with the old gang after a nine days absence from formation. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee in small quantity. Many apparent differences between the men here and in our own exclusive camp on the farm. I have no orders other than to prepare for inspection with the platoon. I go about my work in a half martial manner, little pleased at the prospect of going out to drill after such a poor night's rest as I have had. I will have to break in all over again. In the midst of preparations, bugler sent to tell me I am wanted in Orderly Room. There I am told to report to Batt. Hdqrs. to work an payroll. As soon as Co. Clerk has finished, I find there is still considerable work to be done by him on it. Sit in a cart and begin a letter to Etta..... I owe her a line and am ashamed for having make her apologies for my neglect. It is not going well. My eyes want to shut in spite of me. When rolls are ready, I go to Hdqrs. Find Fox, my partner, has just arrived and is asking instructions from Sgt. Major. Lt. in charge of supply wishes work done under his personal supervision. We find a table to work on. Lt. moves about in camp by telling us rolls must be finished and ready for payment by the 3rd, which is Mon. This means that we will have to work all of today and tomorrow. No holiday in prospect of writing letter to Leah or Mama. Fox wants to quit the job. I say "yes sir" with as much grace as I can muster. I cannot ascertain just how much work Lt. wants us to put in on it, but appears he wants us to take up some of the duties attended to by Co. Clerks last month. He takes me for an authority on the subject of payrolls, which pleases me and acts as a balance for my hurt feelings on learning that I will have no holiday. He leaves us to ourselves. My eyes are just as sleepy as ever, my work is not being done properly. Sheets are full of erasures. Gas Lt. comes in and scolds for not working with our masks on. I have not mine with me, nor has Fox. A respite to go for them, which will take as long as the period for wearing them lasts. Stop with Corp. Haight to point out a few errors in his roll. Go to billet. No one there. I am hungry. Take some jam and hard tack. Get my respirator and report back to Hdqrs. Another half hour sees me on my way back for lunch. Very little of it. Bully beef stew, bread, coffee. I am shown no consideration in spite of detail and must wait my turn on line. Lie down in grass for a nap till 1:30. On way to office meet Jacobsen, who tells me he has a letter from his sister, which mentions Leah and baby. He cannot find it after a search through his pockets. I promise to look him up tonight. Work lazily till time for another half hour period wearing masks. I hear that Sgt. Major is cautioned for neglecting to wear his, so I sling mine to be ready if officer comes, but shut door and do not wear it, until I hear footsteps near door. On it goes for 5 minutes. Period over. Work until 5, getting along quickly. I am further advanced than Fox. Do sums mentally. They are so simple which he ponders with paper and pencil. Perhaps I will have time to write. Supper, cheese, bread, jam, coffee. Hungry. Write in field leaning against tree in great discomfort. I am forcing myself to stay awake. When I have finished, I continue my letter to Etta but I must give it up, when darkness overtakes me. I have only added a few lines to it, which do not please me. Make my bed with Reilly. It seems a little softer than yesterday. I cannot find my overcoat, so I take Leonard's for a pullover. My object is to fall asleep before Fallace, Beger, and their gang come in and keep me from falling asleep by their drunken brawling. Officers are working an a new personnel of squads and platoons. There is a probability that I will be transferred to another platoon, but it is not definite enough to please me. I want to get out. Lie down and fall asleep, almost at once, and enjoy a good nights rest. There has been shelling of some towns and railroad head, as all week. We can hear it from here almost as well as from farm. Air activity nothing to note. Rumors of approaching movement of company still going the rounds, with a little mere authority, as coming from Sgts. A newspaper report of a great victory is a1so peddled about. From nearer sound of guns, it has some credence with me. Bland and Wezerick in hospital. Tallen is in hospital too. An epidemic of grip apparently.

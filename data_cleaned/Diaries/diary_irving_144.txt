Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 8 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Jul. 8, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Poor Up at 2:00. Stomach full of gas and knees weak. I must leave my post twice in one hour, in charge of men coming back from duty on posts. It is quiet except for a barrage in the distance and a few whizzes near us. One thing that I am worried about though. I am sure that I hear a gas alarm some place. It is continuous and without a doubt from a claxton. I am not taking any chances and will be on the alert. My belief that if gas is about, one whiff in my 209present state of health will be sufficient to do considerable damage, and possibly, not being able to spread the alarm in such case, mean death or serious injury to men asleep upstairs. Listen for a long time, so long that had it really been a gas alarm, it would have been passed on to our sector by now, so I decide it is the creaking of the frogs in the pond up the road. It is a warm, starry, beautiful night. I am tempted to say my prayers standing under Mans original temple, the sky. Awaken Conway promptly at 3:30. To bed and long after, even in my sleep, I worry about guns. Up at 8:30. Breakfast. Two pieces of toast and a cup of coffee, which is quite enough for me. My stomach feels much easier. Ready to report to the work squad, I am the first to put in an appearance. Am sent to rout out the others. Meet Jack Curry in a party of three, which is part of the work squad. Remainder comes up and when we are all assembled, Sgt. looks us over and discovers that Curry and I have pistols in our belt. He takes them away. That angers me considerably. A balloon is up over the German lines, which might see us wending our way through the boyau, and it is necessary to bend low all the time. At the Hdqrs. we are turned over to another Sgt., who details us to clean out a dugout, which is the filthiest, most rat infested place I have ever seen. None of us work too hard. It must be made an all morning job if possible. I rest frequently but when I do my mind is most active. I cannot reconcile myself to being on a squad considered as being prisoners. The ordinary, Camp Upton type of work squad would not be so bad, but with prisoners being punished for drunkenness and disobedience, never, not while I have Leah and Cecelie to urge me to uphold my honor. I stop work as soon as possible after helping to store cases of reserve rations. Lie down on bed of pine branches and fall asleep with my troubles. Three aeroplanes up directing artillery fire from trench guns. They are being fired at generously. We keep under cover to keep from being struck by falling shrapnel. Boche planes up to give battle, making the situation interesting. Mess, which I had expected to eat with the boys, is brought for us from F kitchen. Boiled bacon, bread, potatoes, coffee. Read propaganda, printed in German, sent to their lines by the French. Walk to the stream in No-Man's Land to wash the mess kit. One man there is shaving, others washing clothes and bathing feet. On way back, (I do not stay there long) I sit down in an old post, where there is a copy of the Sat(urday) Eve(ning) Post to read a political article by I. Gotta. Stay there until warned that an officer is coming. Back further to where Frenchmen are. I sit down on bench at their table to smoke a cigarette and pass a few minutes in talking French to a Poilu. We get along famously. Others come out from dugout. Men of higher intellect. One has a dictionary. I converse with the aid of the lexicon for hours, carrying on quite a conversation uninterrupted by anyone, until it is time to go back. The other men have been working all this time. We all take back a bag of salvaged material, mine containing wires. I see now just what will be expected of me, and I realize who I am doing penance for. Nevertheless it is degrading being on such a squad, and I resolve not to report again if I can help it. My gun not returned to me, which angers me still more. Dump the bag of wire at kitchen and get back to quarters just in time for supper. Karo and bread, coffee. I am questioned and joshed by the boys. I am miserable enough without that, so I put a stop to it at once, From then on I stay pretty much to myself, going upstairs to write at the open window. I am feeling hot and uncomfortable. Digestion very poor. Though I am hot and perspiring, my head is cold. I lie down, bothered by the flies, put a towel over my head and struggle to overcome a fever. I am 210slightly delirious. Do not sleep at all. Up again to fight. I am afraid I have trench fever. S....., one of our men, was taken to hospital today, complaining of that. Look for opportunity to talk to Lt. He is closeted with officers of 3rd Battalion, talking over our positions. Put up a fine battle with indisposition and in an hour or so I am well enough to write. Lt., Sgt. and men going out on patrol tonight. Jewelry and valuables turned over to me. I remain awake till after 11 oclock all alone, for the first time. Lt. is ingratiating. Up till 9 oclock men have had a bully time singing and throwing things, as is their way when they go on patrol. May as well be happy, for tomorrow we may die, Now all is tenseness and every man has his own thoughts, which he thinks quietly to himself. Complain about closeness of room and light, and display other evidences of displeasure, at being awakened from a sound sleep to go out into the night to endanger their lives. When I put out the light to go to bed, I forget my diary on the table. Lie awake in bed. There is no sleep in me. Hear transport in street. MG fire, shelling. My feverish brain magnifies the sound to bigger proportions and I continually wonder why I am not awakened and made to run across the street to the dugout. A shot is fired in the street, from a rifle. That I am sure will eventually turn out to be a warning signal against gas, yet I make no effort to get up to investigate. Maloy who has come back from post, comes into the room. I ask him what the shot I heard meant. He did not take the trouble to find out and does not know. I talk to him for a time, answering his questions about the dugouts at PA 5, and when he goes to sleep I find myself in the name condition as before, magnifying sounds, exaggerating numbers, so that two men walking in the street below seem to be an army. A new kind of gun is working from our side. No one can describe it to me. Some time during the night the men come in. They are no doubt talking of their work. As near as I can recollect, they were trying to straighten out the casualty list of Germans, who did the damage, etc. Lurid tales of hard fighting and defeat inflicted upon the enemy, with a few losses on our side. But, upon awakening in the morning, the report is the same as usual. No activity on the part of the enemy. We did not go out to look for trouble. Schlesinger shoots at a rat with a rifle. Did anyone ever hear of an intelligent grown up doing such a thing in a house where men are asleep? It sounds like a bomb explosion, as it echoes through the empty rooms. Wade, out sniping, shoots a German similarly employed.

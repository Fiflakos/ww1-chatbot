Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 January 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Jan. 15, 1918 Weather: raining, snowing, windy Health: good Up at 6:00 to find a half inch of snow on ground and falling snow wet and penetrating because blown by wind. Reveille. Inspection of quarters by Lieut. Cook, who reprimands me for not calling Curleys sergeants. I am beginning to think he has it in for me. Everything is mud outside. Water coming in from a hundred leaks in barracks. Wind howls. Issued cartridge belts and bayonets, campaign hats. I construe that to indicate an early departure, which is by no means pleasant to contemplate. Instruction given us on adjusting cartridge belts and drawing and sheathing bayonets. Articles of War read to us again. Sgt. Childs falls asleep. Lieut. Cook shakes him to waken him. Hollifield rifle practice. Signal practice. Cleaning bayonets. Dinner, pork and beans, bread, stewed rhubarb, coffee. I am inclined to believe that rumors of our going away soon are unfounded. This is verified by an announcement to the effect that Company will compete to determine best platoon to compete for entry with benefit of performance in Hippodrome. Get two letters from Leah. Hollifield practice. Bayonet fixing and signaling drill. I am cut across fingers by Jones. Physical exercises. Two more undershirts and OD shirt are issued. Supper, stewed apples, roast beef, potatoes. Take a nap after supper until 8:30. Shave. Write. Answer letter from Dolly about my silence. Lieut. Cook and sergeants in Mess Hall, telling stories. I make out estimates, inventories, etc. for Leah, on jobs she sent me. Sgt. Curley about. H.. on to ... meddling.. matter. To bed at 11. Sleep well. Today at a number of formations, Capt. reads list of names. The most exciting sport.

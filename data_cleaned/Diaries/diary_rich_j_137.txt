Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 24th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 24th. FridayThere has been nothing much doing today. In theafternoon I spent two hours dressing up some "greasy" heeledhorses and then went off 3 kilos away to Ribemont to find outhow Sid Middleton was, but failed as his battalion, 19th, havenot yet come back from the firing line. I walked hard allthe way back through Merricourt to camp and was pleased withthe exercise having walked probably 12 kilometres at a strongpace.The night is not nearly so cold. I slept withouteven putting my head under the blankets, a habit I've got intosince Gallipoli. Over in Gallipoli it was necessary to preventthe dirt from fretting away and falling on your face, as well asto keep out the sound of our own gun fire, or in the daylightsleeping after night work to keep out the strong light. InFrance the only occasion to do it is when sleeping near thefiring line, but it also keeps one a little warmer when blanketsare scarce, and then it drifts into a habit.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 5 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. May 5, 1918 Weather: Raining, Mild Health: Good Up at 7:00. Breakfast in rain. Bacon, bread, coffee. Back to billets. Write. Finish letter to Sachs. Take a nap. Men go to church. Quiet. Awake after half hour just as Fallon comes to call for me. He tells me that a man is wanted at battalion headquarters to figure payrolls. Would I like to have him recommend me for work? I consent. Go up with him. Not wanted to appear personally. Name only desired. To be called when required. Come back to quarters. Write to Leah. Stay indoors until Mess. Stew, bread, coffee. Get second helping. Satisfied. Sun comes out. Looks fair for trip to ........ . Urged to start off at once. Will not do so until I have finished writing. Do so at 3:00. Looks doubtful. Reilly alone anxious to go with me. I mail my letters and set out along main highway, slicker on arm. Do not go far before it rains. Stops and starts again. Pass along road as officers are practicing at miniature rifle range. Go up and down many hills, pass through many villages all built as ours. Look down on peaceful little hamlets from high road. In ........ many trucks are stationed. Men evidently bunk in them when not on duty. A supply base. A steady driving rain now. Almost tempted to turn back, when a car driven by a civilian comes along bound for town. Now many Poilus are to be see in billets in village through which we pass. Company of English returning from action to billets. Pass two companies of Frenchmen returning. The most tired, hard-worked looking set of men I ever saw. Look as if they had not slept for a week. Arrive in ......... . Tip chauffeur a franc, which he does not expect. We insist. Meet some of our company men. Start through streets of city with no idea of direction. More officers than I have ever seen before. Grow tired saluting. A big place where one can buy anything one wishes. Step into a shop, buy picture to railroad station where we see two companies of English passing, field kitchen trailing behind. Walk along canal bank. Into a shop which we buy out of crackers and get some candy to stay our appetites until supper. Worried about whether we can get out of town after 9 at night. Decide to stop at restaurant so we can be free to leave at any time after 8. Into a greasy little restaurant on a side street, full of Australians, English and a few of our boys. Order pork cutlets, potato chips, coffee, bread. In addition 2 fried eggs, more bread, potatoes and coffee, or 4 meals in all, excellent in quality, satisfying in quantity for 8 fr. 60. Raining again. Lose our way. Put right by Tommy. Shelter in estaminet. Have a bottle of stout. Reilly angry with me for not drinking and urging him not to. English inform us we are being cheated in exchange. See comfort stations in streets, a thing which I had heard about but could not believe. Get away at 7. Raining very hard. Our hats are no protection. Water runs down our necks. Reilly silent. I finally consent to take another drink to bring him back into humor. An exceptionally good glass of beer. After a little confusion find road leading out of town. Entertainments for soldiers are numerous, concerts, plays, etc. Walk only a short distance. Get a lift on top of a London bus driven by a servicemen. He quickly picks up a load. All of us chip in a penny as a tip for him. Make excellent time to ......... which is only three quarters of an hour walk to billets. Stop at canteen. More beer for Reilly. Stock up on candy and cake. Walk rest of distance leisurely. Still light when we return to tell boys what a good time we had. A long time since I had had the pleasure of ordering food I wanted of which there was sufficient to excess. Give fellows some candy. Lie about for a while telling of our excursion. Go to bed. Sleep well. Riding down road on bus seems just like a Sunday afternoon's ride down 5th Avenue in New York. Only weather to spoil a perfect afternoon. Thoughts go back to Leah at home while I go on outing with stranger. See extent of preparations made to take up new positions and block advance of enemy in case of retreat by Allies. Good news from front. Our men taking offensive and making gains. Aeroplanes numerous in afternoon. Sustained firing from late afternoon through night.

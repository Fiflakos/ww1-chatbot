Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 20th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 20th. Monday.I washed some clothes and just knocked about absentlytoday. I find there are some 1,500 patients in the temporaryhospital here, mostly men with trench feet. I was told ittakes up to five weeks to cure a bad case of trench feet, butthey only remain here over night.The hospital is entirely of tents, clear white squaretents without any attempt being made to disguise them by paintsplashes from the German airmen. This place was visited everynight for a long time and bombs dropped. One bomb killed 9and wounded 20. The fellows about have become very frightenedof aeroplanes and if there are any Taubs about they go away upon to the hill out of the way. - 19 -I have posted a parcel to Brother Bert with threediaries dating from August to October, also some old lettersand two copper shell bands. This clears me right out ofdiaries now. Somehow or other I hate to send these roughlywritten day to day entries away to be read by others. Theyrepresent my own miseries without any covering of paint andpowder, and even if miseries they can hardly be read correctlyso far away as Australia amongst strange surroundings andaltered conditions. But Bert will be considerate and forgivingI am sure.

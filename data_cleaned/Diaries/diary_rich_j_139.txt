Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 26th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 26th. Sunday.A wet and nasty day. The calendar says it isSunday but there are no indications to prove it either rightor wrong.There was some pretty sentiment about MollieReynold's parcel which arrived today. The socks I will bethankful for and the eatables I will try and hold on to fora while now, as there will probably be hard times comingalong shortly, although they say the 1st Brigade are goingroad making and not into the trenches again.

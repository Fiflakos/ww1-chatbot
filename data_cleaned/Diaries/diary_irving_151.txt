Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Jul. 15, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Fair Up at 8:00 with a problem on my hands. How was I to avoid being put to work with prisoners. There is an air of quiet and thoughtfulness about the men. They are very anxious to knew what Stewart's condition is. No one knows and it is too early to find out. Renny has slept peacefully and is still asleep when I go downstairs for my breakfast, a half hour after arising. There is bacon, bread and coffee. I am tired naturally, and want to go back to bed again, while our men are shelling the Germans again in that peculiar lazy manner, which seems to indicate they are only working their guns to keep them from rusting. Everybody takes advantage of the effect the tragedy of last night has on the Lt., who is in bed, by also going to sleep for a few more hours. I have made up my mind not to bother about reporting, and to wait until I am called or sent for. If by twelve o'clock I am not sent for, I will report sick after lunch. Get up again at 10:30. Wash and shave at the stream behind the house, refreshing me considerably. Were it not for the fact that I was constipated and feeling the effects of last night, I would be enjoying myself to-day, it is so beautiful. The sun is hot and bright. The sky is deep blue, clear and high. As yesterday, my short stay at the stream is a signal for Fritz to open up with his shells. His target is the same as yesterday. I do not linger long, for Fritz is not to be trusted. Upstairs to write. It is quiet and I can do so undisturbed. I smile to see Renny sitting on the floor in his room, cleaning his rifle. I believe no one has said a word to him this morning, nor has he had anything to say. Dinner is delayed to-day There is not much to eat, the fault of the supply man, who is not sending sufficient ration. Men and lieutenant complain. A small piece of steak, potatoes, bread, coffee. Wash my mess kit, tidy my bunk and go in search of Corp. McGovern in charge of work squad. I cannot find him, after a diligent search. I see some of the prisoners, who find an opportunity to admire me for "getting away with it". I protest I had been sick and look much concerned over not being able to find the leader, though I dont care and in fact would prefer it if I never found him. I am thirsty and look for a drink of water, promising to come back in a few minutes. On my way back, I run into the corporal, he recognizing me at the same time. I tell him my tale of woe, and how I would like to see the doctor first. He cannot excuse me and suggests I talk to the captain. I find the captain busy with a French officer and some maps. I cannot interrupt. Wait an hour, in the meantime doing a few small errands for the corporal after 222which I protest that the doctor will soon be in, whereupon I am excused to report after my consultation with him. I find out on my way back that the doctor will not be in until 4:10, which gives me an hour to write. At 4:00, I go to the infirmary. The doctor has not yet arrived. So I read and go upstairs to the prettiest room in town where there are a piano, a rug, arm chairs, etc. Hear that Stewart is badly wounded. The doctor comes. I tell him my trouble. He gives me a big dose of castor oil. An old favorite of mine. To report to- morrow if I do not feel better. Report to McGovern, this time telling him the history of my case and suggesting I seek the Captain after I have my mess, so that I can get an easy detail apart from the prisoners. That suits him and I go back for a mess of beef stew, bread, coffee. As I go to wash my mess kit, I meet Renny in the garden. He tells me how the accident happened. The pistol was fired as his hand hit the wire, when he turned to see who it was that was approaching him. He is a penitent lad and seems glad that he has been ordered back to his company to rest. I console him by fibbing about Stewart's condition. He says the Major has been to visit Stewart and finds him getting along nicely, which does not jibe with what I have heard, yet he may be right. The castor oil is working and I have cramps. I look for Capt. Sturges at his dugout, a hot half hour's walk from my quarters. I see a Boche aeroplane driven down, wounded by our shelling. He is having a hard time to keep his machine from crashing to earth. Capt. is not in dugout, so back to Chateau Headquarters. I find him in the act of reading a list, which should contain my name. I am listed as sick. I interrupt and tell him my story. He understands perfectly and assigns me to his mess. Fine. A good meal is in sight at last. Wants me to bunk with cook. Promise to get my things up some time before dark. A wonderful sunset. I do a little more writing. At eight-thirty I put my things in a shelter half and leave the boys, thanking them for their hospitality, wishing them luck and hoping to see them again. I report to cook, get a fine bed in a large room with a window, which I leave open when I put away my things. It is light enough to write for a half hour and then by candlelight. I add to Leah's letter. A corporal sent up from his company to act as runner, sent to my room to look for a bunk. He is a chatty fellow with whom I spend more than an hour on the causes, etc. of war, putting by Leah's letter to be finished to-morrow. Ask about gas guard, dugouts, etc. After an hours discomfort from the physic I had, I fall asleep to enjoy a real good nights rest, undisturbed by anything determined not to work hard tomorrow. A report of casualties from bombing during the night before.

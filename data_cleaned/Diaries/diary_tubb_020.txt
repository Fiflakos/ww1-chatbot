Author: Frederick Harold Tubb. Date: 20.06.1915. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sunday. Two of the men (Tucker & Chappell)attached to me exchanged withtwo convalescents Wesley & Allenon board a ship that was boundfor the front yesterday withoutpermission I am greatly surprisedat men doing this - I am seeking advice as to what todo in the matter. I see by theTimes of June 4th that L/Col McNicollhas been awarded the D.S.O. & CaptMcGee of the 4th Bn Military Cross& Lt Derham of the 5th a Military CrossPvte Birell of the 7th the D.C.M.I have made out a report of the missingmen giving particulars for the BaseCommandant Col Johnson. Eller &I went to Alexandria after lunch& visited Moharem Bay where afine shooting club is. I nominatedfor 8 events, but did not succeedin winning any. The conditionsare different to our methods The birds (pigeons) which were a splendidlot, are smaller than ours andmuch faster; they are thrown outof a pit, not liberated from traps& by jove they do go. 25 yards isthe nearest mark. I borrowed agrand gun from one of the membersFor every bird that was shot insidethe boundary I should say that twentygot away. The majority of the sweeps(events) were won on two kills 4was the highest & 3 the second highestout of 16 events. The betting systeminterested us. It is done on the totewe did not make expenses but lostonly 16 piastres so didn't do too badly!The shooters were of different nationalitiesand all handled the gun well. We weretold that the shooting here is muchmore difficult than at Monte Carlo, forhere the birds are much faster & smaller!We met Mr & Mrs Gilbert (whom wehad previously met at Mr Singleton's Cairo)at the Regina & had much pleasurein renewing our acquaintanceSgt Stuart of A coy came to see me tosee if he could draw pay thro me. Stuartwas badly wounded in the left arm onApl 25th. He says that they did advancetoo far on tha[t] morning, his unit a few men reached crops & grass country about4 miles from the beach, they of course hadeventually to retire, their losses were heavy.Stuart says that he has been informed thatonly about 20 of the original 7th Bn thatleft Mena are now standing (!)

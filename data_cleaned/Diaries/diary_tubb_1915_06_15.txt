Author: Frederick Harold Tubb. Date: Tuesday 15.06.1915. Nationality: Australian. Very hot. The heat is trying. Onegets up in the morning feelingwashed up out. The flies area d- pest. Am getting fedup of this blooming place! Had a deputation of convalescentswaiting on me this afternoon. They areanxious to take the place of mymen who are equally anxious to go tothe front. (The men who have just comefrom Malta) state that they have hada bellyful of fighting. WednesdayA beastly day blowy & hot & dusty.Vile!! Am going into Alexandriato make inquiries about exchangingsome of my men for Convalescents.I received a memo from Col Elliott,from the front (Anzac Cove) yesterdayto send our machine gun spare parts& some Q-M stores. I have thempacked ready for transit. I enclosedletters to the C.O. & Major Weddelasking them to send for me etcHave heard that Capt Weddellhas been promoted to Major & thatLt Grills has been promoted to Captain(Good luck to them!) A numberof the 7th Convalescent Officersendeavoured to get me on the phoneyesterday to attend a dinner atthe Club. Am sorry that theycouldn't. I would have liked to have beenpresent! 3 pm I am sitting on abox waiting the pleasure of ColScott who is representing GenMcGregor B Mediterranean Base Forces for an interview re my applicationfor the front of some time ago. PeterEller has just left me to go to theVictoria hospital to see Col McNicollWe lunched in the Majestic withCapt Mullen T.O. of the 12th Bn & CaptBannister of the 4th Light Horse andLt Belcher 1st Lt Horse Automobile Officer & CaptBrennan M.O. I wonder whatCol Scott will have to say to me?I wish he would hurry up & send forme. The Army does not care howlong "one" cools his heels" LaterCol Scott informed me that hecould not tell me anything exceptthat I would be notified in duecourse. I went to the Aust Base& found that Col Johnson B.C. 1st AIFand Capt Henry Adjt were away.I left a letter asking for informationEller and I had a bonzahot bath at the Union Club (dec(Officers have been made honorarymembers) I visited the [[photography?]]and saw the proofs of photos of ourtransport sections they were goodWe met at the Majestic (that isis the same party as we were at lunch)and dined famously, afterwhich we walked round & took train for Mena where ourbatmen were waiting with horsesto take us home. We had spenta real good day which weappreciate vastly after the Camplife and fare. I was struckby the large number of Officersin town & in the Hotels & ClubsWe know of course that hundredsof them are convalescents, butthere appears to be a numberthat are not! Things aremuch quieter at the peninsulatrench warfare is in progressplenty of hard work. Thewater is getting scarce asthe men are put on an allowanceof 1 1/4 pints a day so CaptBannister tells us. Bannisteris in the same regt as Maygarhe gave us much news of thedoings of the 4th L.H. Theircasualties were not many (only30) so far. By all accounts theGerman system of espionage is goodWe I daresay there are spies inour Camp here now they were evidentlywith us at Mena. A story is toldthat is corroborated by manyDuring the armistice at thepeninsula when the partiesto bury the dead & collectthe wounded etc. were together aa German Officer remarked toone of our Officers "Many a goodnight I had with you boys atShepheards hotel in Cairo." AndAfter the arrival of the 2nd L. Horsewhen they were going from thesupports to fire trenches a voicein English called out "Hello! Come on2nd Light Horse we know youre there".

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 7 August 1918. Wed. Aug. 7, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Hike 14 Kilometers to ........ Up at 4:30 as day is breaking, after having had very little sleep. I am tired, which is to be expected. Wash and begin to roll my pack. Mess call at Co. F kitchen is the signal for us to go down. E does not leave with us and does not breakfast until 6:30, so we are told to eat with F. In spite of our orders, as usual, it is difficult to get a meal out of them. There is a long line, which we do not care to take the end of, so we lie and swear that we leave at 5:30, ahead of the battalion which gains for us permission to squeeze in at the head of the line, after much argument. Breakfast. Rice, stewed apricots, bread, coffee. Back to quarters, eat there, after which I roll my pack and by 6:30 I am ready. There are many regrets this morning. The men all denounce themselves for fools, because of their debauch last night. The thing that hurts most is that they always begin a long hot hike feeling bad physically, big heads and thirsts. My regret is that I am without money and must begin a long journey, perhaps, without a bit of goodies. Ever since the first day of our travels, I have been penniless. I think I have an hour yet before we go, which I mean to spend in writing. That is interrupted by Lt. Griffiths, who comes with an order to police up. We all get busy. Into the garden next for a few plums. Everybody ready, it is time to fall in. We leave at 7:10 at the head of the column. It has rained considerably in the night and the roads are muddy and full of puddles. We fall out till the battalion forms. Lt. Griffiths notices Doherty without an overcoat on his pack, which begins a cross examination, which discloses that no E men have overcoats. Doherty makes excuses. Lt. calm and collected as usual but hopping mad at us. Looks like trouble for a time, but it blows over. We go off up hill, which is the rule all through the hike. Soon after we start, we must take a 35% grade. One cannot get a foothold in the mud. We slip and make poor progress. Cloudy, but muggy on the woodland path. Come out into the open, where a hilly scene of remarkable beauty unfolds itself. We walk along a road in the center of a dozen foot hills all gold with ripe grain and green and red with clover. Nestling villages and villages on the heights. One large town, our destination, seen from below looks quite near. Its nearness deceives us. A wind, cooling and fresh blows over the open, which makes it a little more comfortable walking. Fall out after 50 minutes. Off again from the top of a hill, while other companies are still below. Turn back to look at the column of men bending their backs in the effort to get to the summit of the incline. Impressive in the extreme. Through ........ where there are some Americans quartered. Into the woods, along an awful rutted road, full of puddles and not a breath of breeze stirring. Fall out for 10 minutes after walking uphill for 50. We must go over the low mountain range, into the valley where the railroad runs. Fall out again and off for the last lap of 4 kilos. Meet Vicker in the woods 266where the supply company tented in the rain for the night. After 1 1/2 kilos walk we fall out, stack arms and unsling equipment to wait for the kitchens to come up and serve dinner. I am very hungry. Lie with my back up in the sun until my clothes dry out. Run down the road to an orchard, where I manage to get a couple of apples and some green plums to take the edge off my hunger. M Co. 3rd Battalion comes in. The Captain buys two kegs of beer for his boys, an act of kindness which I have not, as yet, seen equalled, not even by our Captain. The boys appreciate it very much. F Co. comes up and serves cold bacon, potatoes, bread, Karo and coffee. A miserable meal. G Co. in, so I decide to try their line. With the aid of Wade, I get some rice and potato, stew, bread and coffee. Back to where my equipment is to take a nap on the grass until the army moves to the station. Judging from the size of the station, and loading detail that goes to the station and from what Zucker tells me, I have hopes that we may, perhaps, go out of France. We hike to the station past an English hospital, a Canadian unit, where there are many men, mostly with injured limbs. Fall out and wait to entrain. A wild rush to the YMCA for crackers, chocolate and canned foods. I grub a cracker here and there, but borrow no money for myself. An English- French field bakery across the road. Listen to rumors of our probable destination from the men who have been here from E for a week or more aiding in the movement of troops. They are of the opinion that we go to Italy. We are packed in, 33 in a car, and ship two day's rations. It is entirely too crowded for a two- day trip where men must sleep. The car itself is fairly clean. Conway, who has gone ahead has swept the dung out and it is almost dry. Lt. Cook is with us, full of bull, as usual, and perhaps a bit of booze. Griffiths is still angry with us, judging from the abrupt manner in which he speaks to us. Restless to get under way. The usual excitement and fuss. My maps are out, waiting to pass the first town, to see where we may be bound for. We go south. Try to puzzle the puzzle out, but make no success. Pass beautiful fields along a canal, where Frenchmen are fishing and summering. The women out to greet us as we pass. Children beg for biscuits and in return give us some plums. Lots of water, consequently many factories, in some of which German and Turkish prisoners are at work. Many boys and young girls. Sizable towns. The map reading grows more interesting. It begins to look like Italy, especially when Lt. Hepburn tells us not to touch the ration for to-night. They must last for two days. Where can a two days' trip take us? No one knows. I sit in the door and enjoy the scenery which has the mountains for a background. The boys sing a good deal and cheer the girls. Supper is served at a 15 minute stop. The same trouble in finding out who we feed with. I persuade H Co. to give me hash and coffee, which with biscuit makes a good supper. We munch biscuit all the time. At dusk we see some of our boys, engineers, who are in this country seven months and are permanently stationed here. They do not know where we go. ........, a railroad center out of which six lines run will decide our fate. 3 lines go north and 3 lines go south. Best road in France runs alongside the tracks. At ........, in the dark, talk to MPs who are only in the service since May and who were whisked out of Camp at Spartansburg at once. From there, a town of many barracks, where the lights are lit at night, and which is, so far, unscathed by war. We go up a steep mountain. The engine a fine thing as it puffs hard to pull us up the steep grade. The men go to sleep. Maloy and I remain awake to wait for coffee to be served between 11 and 12. Another reason is that there is no room for us. It grows cold. We cannot find an inch of space to lie down comfortably. Maloy manages. I can find 267nothing better than the box of hard tack 2 x 3 ft. It cannot be done. I remain awake. Seized with cramps. Luckily the train stops. I get the name of the station and look at the map. We are going to ........ without a doubt. That is all I want to know. I get into a corner where Farrell is. Wake everybody to make room for me, which gives rise to much swearing. I manage to make room and fall asleep out of sheer fatigue. At 1, coffee and rum comes. This time I drink it. Excellent. Helps keep me warm for the night. Allays my cramps a bit.

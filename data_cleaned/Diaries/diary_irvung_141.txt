Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 5 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Jul. 5, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. Everybody arises late account having worked during night. Breakfast. Prunes, bread, Karo, coffee. We are having difficulty getting rations from a machine gun unit, who draw them from Supply instead of E. Tell the boys of a dream I had during my last sleep in which I was captured by the Germans and had a good time. More of my companions are there than I ever expected to find. Wash outside, while a number of Heinie aeroplanes are circling about. They are being shot at. One group draws as many as 40 shots. Another battle further north in which almost as much effort is expended to get an American plane over their lines. I am waiting for orders from Sgt. I shave off a big growth of whiskers. I expect to go to 12 post with Gillece. See no reason why I am not ordered to do so. Go upstairs to put myself in way of Sgt. in charge of details. I find Himpler and Conway have gone out, which frees us from duty until the afternoon, after we have had our dinner. A Good opportunity to write. I take advantage of Lt. and at the same time talk to Maloy, who is reading the Staten Islander, recalling different places of interest and people in Staten Island, while the boys wonder how it is we know the same people. It is not long before dinner is ready. The cooks have been issued fresh meat for the first time since our arrival, and make beef stew, kidney beans, bread toasted, coffee. I have eaten a great deal more than is good for the comfort of my stomach and wish to rest awhile before going to work, allowing my dinner to digest as much as possible. Of late I have gone to bed every night with heartburn, 204quite severe, and my excreta is streaked with blood. There is a feeling of inflammation in my stomach or perhaps laceration of tissue. Wait until past one and feeling somewhat relieved of heaviness, get ready to go. Do not wear a blouse or carry a rifle. No one knows the new pass word, so I pin a green band, scout insignia, on my left arm. Halted by guard at end of town, but get by easily, pointing to band. There is one spot on the way up which on passing is sure to bring itself to my attention, forcibly. On right of road is a considerable pond filled with bullfrogs. Sounds like 2 million inhabit it. They work all day long. On left is a loosened blind in the window space of a ruined wall. It swings and creeks in the breeze. The combination of sounds startles me. I cannot become accustomed to it, and liken it to the noise made by a gas shell as it travels through the air, and I am always on the alert as I pass. The sun is strong and very hot. Wise to have left blouse and rifle behind. Up the hill to road and instead of going up to wood, I turn to the right, getting lost for a minute. Gillece discovers that we are not in the right place. We argue about how to get ourselves on the road again with the least trouble. I am sure the best way is to retrace our footsteps. Gillece thinks I am the most contrary person in the world, before the discussion is over, but follows me to what proves to be our road. Into CT and from there to post without any trouble. Men are paying strict attention to observation, showing greater interest than H Co. men, but they are making 7 times as much noise. I tell them they might as well walk on the parapet. One fellow comes along shouting Hun in a voice loud enough to be heard in Berlin. Observation is very good, but as usual see no signs of movement nor can anyone else. At times there are as many as four pairs of glasses trained on the gully, but no movement of any kind is discovered. A great disadvantage to success is the flies. As soon as I have a bead on an object, Mr. Fly lights and plays on my nose and ears, till I cannot remain passive. I shake my head or wave my arms, losing focus on object of interest. When Gillece watches and I nap, I must put a slicker over my head to keep the flies out. I am alone in post at one time when I hear someone whisper, wanting to know who I am. I turn around and am told to get down. I think the order comes from a corporal. As Battalion Scout, I take precedence and tell him so. This is my post I tell him, and as he walks away I see by his boots he is an officer. Observe nothing to report and at 5:45 go back to quarters. Pause on road to light a pipe with my magnifying glass, having no matches. This is dangerous proceeding. It may attract a shell. Not having any success, I give it up, going on to town. Stopped by a new sentinel, walk by him readily with the excuse that password was not given to us, and showing him my band. Get a match and keep on until we wind up in the kitchen where is Lt. My supper saved hot for me. Hamburger roast, potato, bread and coffee. Chat and sit at table with Lt., who when he finishes his mess tells me he would like to see me. I am excited by the thought he has some important mission for me. In his room are three other men, two of whom are sent out to bring back report of activity in a possible raid. Thurn making a report, so long- winded, that I can hardly wait until he is finished. Lt. begins in a manner which bodes trouble, disappointing me greatly. He asks me to sit down and tells me that the General insists on investigating causes for late arrival of message I took down to Hdqrs. yesterday. Lt. has been removed from official capacity as Batt. Intelligence officer and I am punished by being detailed to a work squad for 2 weeks. That is very unfair. I am by no means attached to my present job, but to be degraded by being put on the work squad is by no means pleasing to me, and I insist it was only 15 minutes from 205the time I left, that I got to Hdqrs. with the message. Someone there is trying to cover their delinquency in passing it further. I put up a very able defense and insist upon showing that according to my notation of time I went to bed there is a discrepancy of half an hour in my schedule and theirs. Lt. will try to have my punishment rescinded and in the meantime I will report to the work battalion as a matter of form. I am not told where or to whom. Men all side with me when I tell them what happened. Their experience is similar to mine when on mission to Hdqrs., always finding Sgt. Nichols asleep on arrival. Tell Lt. that and other evidences of importance in our case against the lying highbrows at Batt. Hdqrs. Lt. decides that every message delivered to Hdqrs. must be signed and receipted for. A good idea. Write after holding an indignation meeting until 10:30. To bed. Sleep well.

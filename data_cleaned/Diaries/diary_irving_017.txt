Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 18 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thursday April 18, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Cold Health: Worst day of all. Splitting headache for 7 hours. Up at 8:00. Go on sick call. I would like to do my shift of guard duty but Sgt. Fisher insists that I remain in bed until he calls for me. Along comes Kaplan and insists that I go on guard. We have a slight altercation over it. He threatens to report me for insolence. I get up for I do not want to refuse to do my duty and after a stormy scene enacted before half of guard detail we go to our posts while Kaplan routs remainder out of bed. Do one and a half hour's work and am relieved to get breakfast. This time a little forethought and arrangement is evident. We are served a very good breakfast of liver and bacon, bread, oatmeal and superior coffee. Feeling fairly well. Expect that headache will leave me, I go up on deck for first time during day. Rough seas and a strong head wind. Flying fishes numerous. We run into a school of dolphins. They follow our ship for miles. In plain view from rail. They leap and play in the waves which attracts a great many men to the rails. A big sea sends a shower of spray over deck completely wetting holders of first line positions. A guy rope wired for signal flags has been torn loose and flags fly in strong breeze. Cannot be brought down except by climbing to masthead and gathering in from that end. A dangerous climb necessary. I watch, looking up into a half-clouded sun and exposed to the wind. After a few minutes I feel bad effects of sun and wind in my congested head. A headache, neuralgia, which increases in intensity with every minute, begins. I go below to lie down. Manage to fall asleep and do not awake for dinner. At 2:30 I must get up to appear at boat drill. We get up in quick time. Gusty and cold up forward where we assemble. My head aches so that my eyes water. Seems an eternity before we are dismissed. Back in bunk again till 3:30. Sgt. Fisher places me on sick call again. Doctor gives me a dose of salts and some pills which are nastiest ever, to be taken every three hours. In bunk. Pound my head and toes about in pain. Wash a few handkerchiefs and make my toilet. Feeling worse every minute. Cannot go to supper. Ask boys to bring me a cup of tea and some bread. Very kindly they oblige me, but I cannot touch food. I ask Sgt. Lemmon to report to doctor and ask his advice. Comes back with news that nothing can be done for me. I try my best to sleep and when I succeed, a game of quoits is started which creates much excitement and much noise. My bunk used as a chair by 4 men taking away what little air and light there is. I must get angry and use force to dislodge them. Game goes on as before, noisier than ever. Headache much abated so I get up for a little walk. Eat bread and jam and manage later to get a cup of coffee. Upstairs to see what night looks like. Clear, moon and stars out. Downstairs to write. To bed at 1:30. Sleep well. Lanterns are ready, lit and placed at convenient points in corridor to be used in emergency that engines are damaged and lights go out. Smoke bombs by boats to be thrown overboard if danger demands. Men not permitted to approach with lighted cigarettes or cigars. Captain has managed to procure some good coffee and a bun for our company. A complaint about the food has been made to him. System in Mess Hall is changed to better service. Nearly a collision between our ship and another due to signals being misconstrued. Distance between ships is barely 50 feet.

Monday Oct 12thIn the afternoon we marched infull dress, with waterbottles & pouch downto Bondi beach, where at the cost of5d most of the company went intothe surf. I could not see howI was going to get down to Manlyby fair means so I just brokeaway after the swim walked up toBellevue Hill caught the tram to theFive Ways where Joe Neilson isworking for Williams, Chemist. I wrapedup my belt haversack & bottle andcarried it down to Hill Bros. where Igathered 1 doz silk stocking for W.Z. andwith W.W. Hill took the 6 p.m. boat,I returned by the 10.15. I don't knowwhat to make of this girl. I should, andbelieve, would, marry her, if I could seeahow I was going to provide a homein comfort. Marriage without a comfortablehome and a settled position cannot be otherthan a failure. (Bed at 11.50.)

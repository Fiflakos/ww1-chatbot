Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 29 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Monday April 29, 1918 Weather: Raining, Cloudy Health: Good, left leg hurts Up at 6:00. Straggle outside for reveille. Everybody too tired to get up. Go up for breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Have an egg and a glass of milk from Madam, which all together makes a passable breakfast. Take a nap for a half hour. Drill call sounds. It is cloudy but does not look like rain. Not having orders to the contrary, we go up without overcoats, rest of company wearing overcoats. I am cold. Move off for drill field. Warm enough when marching but when we rest I almost freeze. Captain leading company. Two new lieutenants with us. One a crank on manual. It begins to drizzle. Close order drill for two hours. Drill field becomes a sea of mud from tramping of many feet. Ten minute rests every hour. Then it is necessary to swing arms and run around in circles to keep warm. A long line of Red Cross Ambulances pass along road. Probably wounded men from yesterday's fray. At eleven o'clock three Englishmen come up with Lewis machine guns. One squad from each platoon detailed to be instructed in working of Lewis gun. My squad from 3rd platoon. Ten of our men assigned to each instructor. Our man a Cheshireman. It is very difficult for us to understand what he has to say. He takes gun apart and explains working of different parts and names of each. After half an hour we are dismissed to make way for another company. Rejoin platoon which is working with bayonets under Sgt. Kaplan. It begins to rain. Miserable without slickers. Hardly expected that we would continue to drill. Assembly sounds. Ready to thank Captain but on looking at watch see that it is 12 o'clock, time to go back. Clear again. Flounder back in mud, very tired. Dinner. Boiled beef, potato, soup, no bread. Rest an hour. Go up for drill with overcoats on. Wrong again. Go to drill field. On way down we fall out to change for slickers. Close order for half an hour. Men deficient in manual left behind. Rest of company moves off for patrol work on roads. Detachment picked for van and rear guards. Main body in center. Not given any explanation about work. Just walk up and down roads. Halt and go forward at command from connecting files. On drill field to rejoin company. It rains. Captain continues work. It seems to me that he defies elements until it stops. Back under difficulties. Wash and shave. Mess call sounds earlier than usual. Late. Must get on end of line. Rice all gone. Get cheese, hardtack, jam, cocoa, of which I get another cup later. Write, read, go to bed at 9:00. A little fun in the dark. Wake up at 2:30 to find it raining hard. Sleep well rest of the night. Artillery not very active today. Heavy gun firing has abated somewhat. Lieutenant tells us of British gains yesterday. A source of worry and speculation is sound of bursting shells very close to us, apparently no more than 7 or 8 miles away. They sound like giant crackers. Echo rolls through hills. Gun carriages and communications wagons going up to the front. Captain and 2 Sgts. scheduled to go to front today but are not permitted to go near. Aeroplanes go over in late afternoon, flying very low, singly. In early evening come back in squadrons. Sound of motors is heard, but they cannot be seen until they emerge from the clouds. They come into sight very suddenly and then go right into or over another cloud bank. Appear to he flying sidewise. Englishmen tell of great masses of Germans being slaughtered in Flanders offensive. Post letters to Leah and Mama. Tobacco and cigarettes issued. Enough for 2 days.

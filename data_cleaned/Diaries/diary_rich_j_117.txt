Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 25th March 1918. Nationality: Australian. March 25th. Sunday.Morning Parade:-- 9.30 to 10.45.Church Parade.Leave to visit Amiens from 11. O'clock.I have heard that the only building left standing atBapaume was the old Town Hall. Our troops and a ComfortFund people went into it and five days after the Germansleft it they blew it up with a contact mine. About 40 personsbeing injured. This goes to show clearly that theGerman can never be trusted at any time. So if biscuits arefound for instance rest assured they are poisoned. If anythingis found at all just ask yourself the question as towhy he left them behind.

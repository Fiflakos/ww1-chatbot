" " " practice.Musketry.Afternoon Parade:--Map Reading.Command Practice. 1700 lecture Fire Discipline and Controleby Capt. G. G. Campbell.Major Harris in his lecture stated that he thought it bestto number the Sectons in each Platoon respectively 1.2.3.4.Anybody might get into complications with the present systemof numbering sections up to 16 as at present in this newscheme of trench attack."Moppers Up" will make the third line advancing in fairlyclose formation instead of being scattered about more so astheir work necessitated their bunching together at thecommencement of their duty in cleaning up a trench.Moppers up may be drawn from another Platoon if theattack is for 2 Platoon. If a Company is in attack the"Moppers Up" may be drawn from a different Company but theymay also be drawn from the Company's own strength.The advancing formation and the "Jumping Off" trenchformation remain very much the same as in the attack practicedearly in the term with the acception that the first sectionof each Platoon are riflemen, The 2nd. Rifle Graniders 3rd.Bombers 4th section Lewis Gun.We practiced two systems of getting out rapidly from thetrench into formation. Firstly, be keeping the sections togetherin the trench as per diagram and then by spliting thesections up and placing the men in the direct front they willadvance over. viz. men from 1.2.3.4. sections taking theirposition alternatly. This latter system was not generallyfavoured. Attack Two Platoon Front. ||||||||| 1st. Line|8 Bombers|Sgt.|8 Rifle||Riflemen|Stg.|Bombers|)| |7|2|5||1|1|3|) 1st. Wave| 2nd. Line|L G Team|Plat.

" Discipline.These three essentials have been time and again impressedupon us by Army so we have endeavoured to instill this intoyou Officers and N.C.O.s in our Musketry and Range drill.General Gough of the 5th Army wants better efficency in theuse of the rifle.The rifle is a powerful and accurate weapon and so menhave to be skilled in its use or its efficency is greatly reduced.There is no set standard on maximm as to the usersability to make it accurate. It is not a matter of pushingfive rounds into the magazine and getting bulls eyes, even,there must be controle and Direction. Fire may be directedfrom Coy. Commands down through the whole company where thesection commanders are left to see that it is done correctlyand properly. Controle of fire will be Platoon commandersduty. To have perfect controle it would be possible to turnon fire as though it were a hose being switched about. Iffire is opened too early it fails in its objective. Themoral effect of a sudden burst of fire on the enemy will begreat. Be carefull not the expend ammunition unduely. Thereare two kinds of fire "Rapid" and "Deliberate". Rapid fireshould be held in reserve as long as possible for especialtargets Visual training for Secton commanders. In givingorders under fire always use the same terms as the men areaccustomed on the parade ground men will easily understand.To get good fire discipline men must be well and carefullytaught on the parade ground. Observation of the enemyby keeping the eye alway fixed upon him while loading orhandling the rifle.70% of shots have been found to be wasted chiefly byfiring at wrong target and faulty ranging.For further details 115 to 117.

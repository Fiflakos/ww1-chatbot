Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 23 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tuesday April 23, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up at 5:00. Awake very cold. Boys who came in late could not find their blankets. They make a collection from men sleeping near at hand, leaving each only the necessary one. I have only one. An air raid is supposed to have taken place during night but I heard nothing of it. Wash and breakfast. Ham, jam, bread, coffee. Issued three tickets. Make up packs and company formed ready to move. Blankets are turned in. Ground policed. It begins to rain. Company moves off to railroad station. Packs with added weight of steel helmet and gas masks soon become a burden. The pace which is set by the Captain too fast. Route through the city, narrow streets, slippery pavement. See damage to buildings caused by air raids. A prosperous looking place with many large factories from which a busy hum is heard. and well-stocked shops, with the exception of the butcher shops which look depleted. No men are to be seen except in uniform. Children going to school. Halt only for passing trains. No rests. Walk was about three miles. At station we hand in our meal ticket at canteen and receive 2 sandwiches, 1 egg, 5 buns and a cup of good hot coffee, which is our ration for the day. Wooden boxcars holding from 36 to 40 men waiting for us. They are filthy being littered with decaying food, coal, wood, paper. Trains full of wounded come in from the front, men on leave and small caliber field pieces. Huge guns mounted on railway trucks also, camouflaged to resemble foliage. Fill canteens and chat with Scots and English who go again to front. A cheerful lot not inclined to brag about anything they have done or the wounds they have received. Sun comes out as we leave RR yards. Noisy, jolting cars. A flat wheel directly under me. Have a short nap. Put my rations in steel helmet. Nothing to occupy our attention. Scenery commonplace. Hundreds of coolies working on railroads. Arrive at RR station in a half hour or so. Detrain and get another cup of hot coffee. Short rest and we start off hiking to our billets. Have no idea of the distance to be traveled. Adjutant issues order that we make only 2 and a half miles an hour which arouses my suspicion that it will be a long walk. Pass English camp and base hospital, great salvage yards and storehouses all in perfect order. Coolies go about with mess cans slung from their shoulders. Get a rest again for ten minutes. Then go for 45. See farms of Northern France. Long avenues of trained trees. Only one residence of consequence seen. Old lady pointing at my cartridge belt shouts at me: "Germans finish". I do not know whether that means I am to kill Germans or they are to kill me. Meet Lt. Cook on the road. He tells us we are going to a fine place. Men are beginning to drop out of ranks under strain. My left foot is blistered on sole and pack hurts my back. I whistle and sing in an effort to forget. Next rest we are quite hungry. I am out of luck. I have no rations. Lt. Stevens to whom I gave my tin hat to hold, while I jumped off the train, did not know I had food in it and spilled contents. Captain becoming annoyed at showing of his men. Passing trucks pick up stragglers. Go down a most wonderful avenue, lined with tall trees on both side. They are free of branches except for a tuft on top. Plod on under difficulty. Meet up with Major who halts entire battalion until all stragglers are picked up. We rest an hour during which I lunch on bread and bully beef and manage to procure a glass of buttermilk, freshly churned. Learn from Tommy that we are only 35 miles from front. Men who are billeted in a town we have just passed tell us we have 10 minutes to go. This proves to be 3 miles. Enter gates of a French town admirably situated in a valley. Officers push ahead, while in rest, to locate quarters. We are marched all around the village to house us all- 20 or more in each barn. A beautiful place, but we are disgusted at finding we must sleep in barns. Almost too tired to go to mess. Field kitchen comes up too late to cook anything but coffee. We get 1 bully beef sandwich besides. Field kitchen a quarter mile away from our billets. Listen to a conversation in French between Sgt. Fischer, who is acting as interpreter for the Lts. and Madame, who tells where we are and what has happened, with the aid of a map. After mess, I go into estaminet and drink a glass of porter, first drink in four years. Excellent stuff. Boys buying it all up. They get all the wine and champagne they can hold. Some tipsy. Atmosphere of place full of rustic romance. Go to bed at 9:00, wondering if rats will disturb us. Hear the roar of battle. From sunset, guns boom incessantly in the distance, star shells and rockets seen in sky. Aeroplanes. Realize for first time how near we are to front.

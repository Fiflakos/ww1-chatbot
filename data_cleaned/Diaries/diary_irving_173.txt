Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 6 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Aug 6, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Showers, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, butter, coffee. It is raining, a nasty drizzle. Eat indoors in a barn, where some of our men are billeted, to get out of the rain. Most of the boys there are taking entirely too much liberty with me. I decide it is high time to put an end to it. Hereafter, some of the men will not be permitted to use any nicknames when addressing me. The company has a formation this morning. I am very much surprised that men, who are on the hike and my be ordered to proceed to-day at a moment's notice, should be put to work at such a tiring monotonous business as skirmishes. They go to the foot of the mountain for the purpose. The only advantage of having the men working is that they will be less likely to get drunk. Pity the poor fellows and am glad, once more, that I am not attached to the company. Go to quarters. Wash and police. Hardly finished my toilet, when the Lieut. announces he wants all E and F Co. men to take a walk with him. Full equipment is to be worn. Purpose of formation is unknown. Some F men are in the other billets and have been forgotten, another is asleep in his bunk upstairs, and no one has thought to wake him, so assembly is very much delayed. The Lt. is angry. He takes us to the road leading from the village, and there begins to hold class. Begins by telling us we have an easy time of it, but if we have grown unaccustomed to answering calls quickly, we may return to our companies, where that discipline is never forgotten. The guilty ones say nothing, but inwardly resolve that it is best not to spoil a good thing. Lt. then apologizes for calling us without warning, and that it was a divisional order that had not yet come, when he spoke to us yesterday. The purpose of the formation is to acquaint us with the principles of scouting and observing in open warfare work. We may have occasion to use what he will tell us very shortly. Of course that leads to only one conclusion, as far as our next move is concerned. He knows that we will draw that inference and tells us there is nothing official as yet, as to our destination. Our time is spent sitting around him on the ground listening to his lecture. The battalion runners come along later, to get a little lecture on signaling to aeroplanes, the same as we received yesterday, which we have not yet forgotten. After that we are dismissed to do as we please for the day. There will be no movement until to-morrow, we are told, when every man will travel with an overcoat on his pack. We are to get ours at E Company. Corporal Doherty and the rest of us vow not to carry any. There is time left before dinner to get a handful of plums from the garden in the road. They are not quite ripe, yet I eat them. The good ones have been discovered by others than we and are gone. Write for a little while and then go for dinner. It is a prize dinner. We help slice potatoes for frying while we wait. The company has not yet returned, which delays our being fed, until finally we prevail on the cooks to give us our portions of steak, onion gravy, fried potatoes, bread, coffee. That is the most tasty meal in a long time and is so generously dispensed, that I cannot eat seconds, which were also given. I have heard that Corp. Kiernan has an extra pair of trousers, which causes me to look for him. He usually is to be found in the rooms of the old couple who live in the back of the church, but now he is not there. I inquire for him and while I wait, I have more than a half hour's very ... conversation in French with Grandma. The Captain has 400 Frs., which he will lend in sums of 10 Frs. each to men of the company, who will apply for it. The list is filled quicker than a Camp Upton pass list. Go back to my billet to write. The boys are noisy and boisterous, due to vin blanc, in which they 264have already invested some of the borrowed money. In a half hour or so I fall asleep over my book, after which I resume and finish. Into the garden once more for plums. Also look for edible vegetables in the truck garden behind the house, which nobody seems to own or look after. Rain drives me inside until upper time. Supper is served in the rain. Meatballs, potato, beans, coffee, bread. I eat in another barn, where I must stay until a very heavy shower is over. I look for the extra trousers Kiernan has, where I have been told by him they are. Find them in better condition than my own and take them. Next inspect the overcoats, which are left from E Co.'s allotment, for the purpose of finding my own, which has a fine pair of kid gloves in one of the pockets. I find many others but not mine, so I take none, to have pack uniform with other men to-morrow. No one urges me to take any. Called outside, while I am going over the coats, to see a wonderful sight. A flock of sheep, so big that it chokes the entire road, is coming down the hill. No one has seen it before and all question what they are being brought into town for. It is marvelous how they follow the leader and the obedience to the command of the shepherd and the fear, of the two dogs, which they display. Stand a long time watching how the shepherd goes among his sheep to single out those he returns to their owners. Everybody in the town sends their sheep to graze on the hillside under his care. He leaves sheep and lambs with almost every householder. They have distinctive marks on their hindquarters. The 1000 or more sheep are delivered half in each of the two streets. There is lots of fun when the boys, surprised at the army of sheep, command them to "right dress", "over in file", etc. Even the Major, who is looking out of a window, is amused. In my billet with nothing to do. It is no use writing a letter, as it cannot be mailed. Look at my shirts for cooties. Glad to find none. Talk to the men, shave, and start a letter which I stop writing when the men come in with two helmets full of nuts and two canteens full of white wine. They have 3 friends from E Co. with them. I anticipate little sleep to-night, which is not a pleasant prospect, since we must be up at 4:30 in the morning. It immediately becomes very noisy, everybody talking at once, laughing, shouting, singing and swearing. I take a few nuts and a mouthful of wine, stay with them a little while and go to bed. I am very sleepy and doze off. In the next room the spirit of revelry grows stronger. Canteens are being taken downstairs for refilling as fast as they are emptied. The jokes and songs become more ribald and the noise more unbearable, so that it awakes me and keeps me awake. The medical men downstairs shout up to the scouts to keep quiet and let them sleep. They come up to plead and threaten, when at first they are not heeded, and say they will report to Lt. Griffiths. After a while the noise not abating, they do so. The Lt. calls for the Corporal, who staggers downstairs, and orders them to put out the lights and send the men to bed. They obey and dismiss their friends, afterwards arguing and discussing the wonderful time they had. It is not long before they are sick. Black the worst. Simpson comes into my room and tells how he just had to let loose to get relief from worry over a great wrong he has done and cannot correct, which is causing sleepless nights. Only he in the world knows. I am sure that we will know it in a few minutes, and my judgment proves correct. He talks like a good boy who wants to do justice to the person sinned against and I feel sorry for him, but my good opinion of him is lowered. I too, while I lie in bed, and all day and for a long time past, have felt like letting loose, but I have not, nor would I in such a manner as he has found for letting off steam. I feel guilty for not having written to anyone this week and I want very much to hear from home. No letters have 265come for a long time. I miss many of Leah's letters. There is no activity of any kind that we are aware of to-day. The old woman I spoke with at noon tells of such bloody battles in the streets of the town in the early days of the war. My comrades remind me of a mass of wriggling, restless worms in a dung pile, during their debauch. Idle, idle all the time, till liquor gives them something to find interest in. They now are not allowing themselves a moment's rest. Each wants to outdo the other in lewdness.

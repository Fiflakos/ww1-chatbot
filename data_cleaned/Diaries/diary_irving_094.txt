Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 18 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. May 18, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast, oatmeal, jam, bread, coffee. At Reveille it is announced that Company will be ready at 6:50 for a hike to ........ . Mess kits and tent poles and pins will be taken. Kitchen follows with water carts. Machine gun and SOS schools do not go. I have lots of time to clean my gun for some practice shooting today at a range we will build in the woods for our own use. We assemble with picks and shovels and burlap. One company absent. Another late. They come up just as it has been decided to leave me behind to wait for them and march them down to where we will work. Go to woods. Halt in a spot not far distant from where we worked yesterday. Divided into two shifts by taking front rank, in which I am, for half an hour and then rear rank and so on. Nine men in shift, divided into three shifts. Get stakes out of a tree which someone chopped down yesterday, mark out our ditch and begin digging, after building up bit of fret work to retain dirt thrown up by us. Easy shoveling. Soft earth, yielding. Unaccustomed work for me. Perspire freely. Change shifts. Take a look around in forest. See strange things in the shape of insects. Black begins carving his name on the bark of a tree. I am moved to do likewise. My first offense. I begin with the idea of carving only my own initials, but as I work it occurs to me to let that aged tree know another secret in addition to the many that it already knows, that I love Leah and Cecilie. I an interrupted to take another hand at the digging. It is harder work now. A stratum of rock has been struck, which must first be loosened with the pick. We find soft earth again making it easier for the next and last relief. They finish as Lieut. comes up with burlap and wire to fix up five targets by cutting up into strips, making five holes in one and stretching it across two stakes. Tin is looked for and, when found, piece is rounded out and nailed to a forked twig and we are ready to shoot. I am well along with my carving. Lt. and a man get into pit to work target and score. Three men are posted on road behind range to watch if any shots go over embankment at back of trench. Five men get ready to shoot, prone position. It must be spotted and shot at immediately. It may appear at another opening for other men or perhaps at my hole. Quick aiming necessary. I make four out of five shots. Resume carving, while balance of men shoot, unconcerned in what they are doing. I must give up my labours to return for mess. We are dismissed until Monday morning. Cheers. We expect a good dinner. Rations left behind for us are a disappointment. Canned bully beef, jelly, hard tack. Bread supply and coffee exhausted before we arrive. Coffee is being made. I would like a glass of milk instead, so I do not wait, but go in search of some. Get enough to satisfy, then take my water bottle and gas mask and go back into the heart of the woods to finish carving my initials. I am alone. I meet one of our men, but he goes on his way. Blade of my knife breaks while I carve Cecelia's initials. When I an finished, I sit down on tree stump to write a letter to Leah. One of the men, who was with us this morning, comes with a detachment of men and CPI from his company to shoot. They slight the range we had built in morning. Shoot on one made by themselves. I become drowsy and fall asleep. Awakened by the sound of thunder. A shower coming. I hurry back to billets. It begins to rain. I feel sorry for the men who are out with packs on hike. Lie in straw and write. Men come in at end of slight shower. They have been reviewed again by the English and spoken to by General. Not pleased with proceedings. Fall out for retreat. Mess. Cheese, jam, bread, coffee. Write again until dark. Slowly. Cannot concentrate. Take a walk around the house to get into the open, so that I can see the flashes of light coming from where the guns are roaring once more. A fairly intensive defense. A few loud reports may be explosion of bombs dropped from planes. Only scouts up over us tonight. Go to bed at 10. Sleep well. Some extra straw softens my bed.

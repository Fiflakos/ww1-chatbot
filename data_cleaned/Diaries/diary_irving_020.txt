Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 21 April 1918. Location: England - France. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sunday April 21, 1918 Weather: Clear, Mild Health: Headache In England - France Up at 6:30. Half hour before whistle blows, cold and stiff. Blinds are removed from windows. Daylight discloses a cliff in rear, sea gulls, crows and other birds nesting on slopes. A castle in the distance. Small neat brick houses, a few grey concrete. Aeroplane is circling overhead. Sun coming up, takes chill out of air. Go downstairs to wash and make a tour of inspection. See black bread on tables in Mess Hall which excites my appetite. Tell glad news to all the men. Many English soldiers about whom I cannot distinguish from officers, they are full of brass buttons. Find a Canteen and YMCA house. Yard is full of men, balconies lined too. Canteen is opened. Stormed by men for cake and chocolate, cigarettes, etc. One fights way to front and buys for us all. Breakfast. Wheat bread, ham, jelly, coffee. Quickly served. Food good. Thankful for first piece of wheat bread since I am in army. Go into shelter in mountain side which is to protect against air raids. Talk to English Tommy about conditions at front. Describes them as horrible. Scotch, Irish, British subjects of all climes there to leave with our draft. Manage to mail letters written Friday. Girls and begging children outside of gate. Large numbers of women workers in uniform are about. See bicycles frequently. On inquiry find they are still the fashion. Find English army discipline is very strict. Men like statues in presence of officers. Company formed for a hike along roads which are lined with children begging for pennies. Every other house is a tavern. Old women numerous. Houses very old. Can see neat parlours and in every window a nosegay of fresh flowers. Follow road along cliffs. See fortifications. A wonderful view across channel. Hillsides covered with a wonderful carpet of green. Permitted to fall out. Spring to right of road and almost go over a sheer precipice 100 ft. above beach. Falls away so sharply that it is not seen till I am almost to edge. Captain comes up to take in view. Listen to wash of waves on beach below and follow gulls and ships that look like rowboats. Lie on grass, sun warming me, bask and start a letter to Leah. Ordered to fall in and get back in time for dinner. Mutton stew, bread, jam. Finish letter and manage to post it before company is assembled with pack on backs. March to boat landing admired and cheered by all. See ambulance cars which carry wounded. Board boat again put in deepest hold. Hot and stuffy. Head throbbing again. Long time before we get started. Get in a nap. Ordered to put on life belts and go on deck. Orders reversed. Begin to perspire profusely. Stomach turns. Just manage to reach deck. Vomit. Well in few minutes. Headwind very strong. Chills me. Get news of recent events from deckhand. Conscription in Ireland and an air raid last night over Calais. Surprised me. A very swift boat. Shores of France in plain view. Destroyers with us. Boat docks. Ready to disembark. Company lines up on quay. Captain gives us a little close order drill to impress English and French officers about. All most disinterested people. Start on a two mile hike along a gray dusty road to rest camp. Boys from USA our advance guard going into town. We envy them. Blind men everywhere. Weight of pack and headache great annoyance. Cannot enjoy sights I see. Fortifications and air raid shelters. Aeroplanes scouting overhead. Not a vestige of anything but military. Arrive in Camp. No greeting. Tommies are queer reserved people. They have nothing to do but lounge. Quarters in three longbase barracks without lights. We are given a ticket which entitles us to supper. Bread, cheese, jam and tea. Fill up to capacity. Wholesome stuff. Some men manage to get beer and wine which puts them in good humor. Issued three heavy blankets. Worried about deportment in event of an attack. Make up a bunk on floor together with Eifert. Lie down and try to forget headache but cannot for a long time. I am a nuisance to bunkmate. Fancy I hear booming of big guns in distance. Dream of home. A very full day in which I try to be interested, realizing how near we are to front and that we will soon play our part in the big game. German prisoners are here.

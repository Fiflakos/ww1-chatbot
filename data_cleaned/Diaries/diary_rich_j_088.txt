Tuesday Sept. 22 nd A route march of some 10 miles out passed Maroubra this morning I did not enjoy it a little bitJack Sullivan marched out of stepas usual and even the officersleading could not keep in step,and it jars my nerves to bewalking without harmonising.I left the ranks without leave andwent out in a sulky and lovely horsewith Joe Neilson.

Toward evening in possible danger zone. Bakers arrested for selling rolls. Take advantage of my cold and lie abed until after Reveille, one eye open and one ear cocked. I listen to all the calls and all the bustle but I play fox, Get up in time to wash and make bed before breakfast. Barley porridge, bread, butter, coffee and stew which is not fit to eat. Shave down in hold with water from my canteen. On a little job for Sgt. Curley, first bit of fatigue duty I have done since boarding ship. Carry pail upstairs to empty it. That arduous duty over, I am free to go on deck. We are in a different formation. There are now two boats on starboard side, cruiser in port not in front as usual. Smoke and lounge about. Nothing to read. Boat drill at nine. Everyone present. Dismissed. must go below to get rifles. Looks like inspection. Go downstairs and feverishly polish some more. I am last one up. Afraid I would have dirtiest gun. Inspection. My gun is one of the best. New men and signalmen remain for work. I remain and watch both classes work. Sit on port anchor, smoking and watching waves. Flying fish numerous. Much shifting of positions of ships and a great deal of flag signalling. Remain at port until time for mess. Dinner. Lentil soup, potatoes, cabbage, meat which it is sinful to serve, stewed dried peaches. On deck to take advantage of sunshine. Get a bit of old newspaper from Corp. Dougherty and settle myself to read. From nearby, cry goes up, "whats that? A torpedo." I jump, lifebelt ready. See in distance what appears to be cloud of spray. It is travelling in direction of one of our fleet. It changes its course and heads for us. No effort made to avoid it but great excitement on bridge and deck, Telescopes and glasses much in demand. We decide object is a whale spouting. Another appears a short distance ahead. This develops into a cloud of smoke clearly visible, which rises to a considerable height. Tension relieved. They are smoke bombs. Presently they are sent off from every ship. One of then produces a remarkable smoke screen, which hides entire fleet from our view. When cloud lifts, cruiser which was leading is seen coming toward us at right angles and then to our rear. Great speed. She remains behind, cruising until evening, when she takes lead again. At most interesting moment, we are ordered below to wait call for drill. Good time. Dismissed. Sleep on hatch for an hour. Rumours that a submarine was sighted is going the rounds. Crewmen drilling. Signalmen working. Pugh, who has missed formation, given fatigue duty by Lt. Cook. Supper. Worst yet. Bread and butter and tea. There was fish, too, but I was not satisfied with the odor of it. Start a new book. Sorrows of Satan". ....... in the dusk. A strange game is being played on deck forward. A man is corralled and downed and his bottom is bitten by boys. Many caught. Down in hold to read when darkness falls. Hungry. Make trip to canteen. Nothing sold but onions, which strange to say are good. Tonight a guard is posted to watch over boats. Each boat will have a man in it at all times. I volunteer to do a shift, wishing to see everything in case of accident. My offer accepted. Pieces are loaded and locked and orders are to permit no one to enter boats except ...... Shoot to kill, if necessary to avert panic or accident. Write and read till eleven thirty. Sleep well. These are interesting days, full of the spirit of adventure. Not a man among us who would show white feather. Search horizon for signs of convoy. Watch is doubled on ship's bridge and on crows nest. Fleet travels without a single light showing at night. Nothing but black hulks to be seen against gray sky and water.

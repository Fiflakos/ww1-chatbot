Authors: Irving Greenwald. Date: 19 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. May 19, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:45. Reveille. 1st. Lieut. in command. Capt. has been promoted to assist Major. Announcement made that no one will be permitted to go to ........ without a pass. I was anxious to go to buy some presents for Leah, Cecelia and Mama. I hate to ask Lt. for a pass. We are not better related than when at Camp. Other instructions about inspections during the week are given. Notice posted about show the Co. is giving at the Gas Field, Tuesday night. Breakfast. Rice, jam, bread, coffee. Air blankets. Wash and shave. Look about for a bucket in which to wash my clothes. All being used. Much in demand. Some of the men have gone to a stream down road past ranges, where they can wash clothes and bathe their feet. I lie on grass over Reillys shelter tent half and write a check for Rachel to buy a bouquet for Leah with. Write a letter to Mama. Enclose a duplicate check with instructions to be used in event that other goes astray. Tiresome lying on my stomach. Change places to shady spot. Take a nap while I write. Stay there until Mess. I take my letters with me to Orderly Room. Ask Lt. to OK, explaining that it contains nothing of military value. He says to stay while he looks at it. He turns to last page, at once, and he puts his OK on it without reading contents. OK on envelope. I seal it and give it to Company Clerk. Wait under a tree until Mess is ready. It is an hour late, but worth waiting for. Act. Capt. is playing ball with the men. I lie in readiness to catch a ball if one comes my way. None comes. He does not appear to notice me. Continues batting ball until it is lost. Dinner. Steak, onions, potatoes, bread, coffee. A good meal. Hot water to wash dishes too. Real comforts. Back for a little rest. Clean my gun. Lie down with Kronenberg in the shade without OD shirt or shoes or socks on, after having washed a suit of underwear, 2 prs. of socks, 2 towels, 2 hdkfs. I have paper and pencil with me. Also binoculars to look at scout planes which are up in numbers. I write a letter to Matt and one to Lou. Supper. Cheese, jam, bread, coffee, write. When it is dark Reilly proposes a walk. I consent. We get outside on road only a few paces from house, when a military policeman makes us return to quarters. Everybody off roads at 9:00. Sit down against a wall of barn outside and talk with Reilly of Staten Island. Moon is so bright that I can read a paper by light of it. Go to bed at 10. Artillery has been active major portion of day and since nightfall has doubled in intensity. Ground rocks from force of repeated shocks. I feel a little bit shaky from continued thunder of guns. As I lie down Reilly says he hears Boche planes. Strain my ears, but it seems like our own motors are heard. Nevertheless, I am frightened for the first time since coming to France. Lying on my back I think that if the plane, which hovers right over our barn flying low, apparently were to drop a bomb on us, there would be the end of me. I would not like to die like that. I cannot sleep for the thought of it and the persistent rattling of the artillery beyond. A big night's work out there. I count the wounded, see the dying and picture the misery of those at home. I lie awake for hours, sick with sorrow for Leah and with bitterness at myself for not having stayed on train when I was on my way home to see Leah and baby. From the sleepers at the left end of barn comes the sound of singing, faint at first, but swelling in volume as the sound goes on. A sweet voice, weird, uncanny, under the circumstances. Men awake or have been awake for the same reason as I, laugh. A few minutes interval. He repeats his songs. Men begin to complain. To cap the climax, Tallon begins a song. A foolish, sloppy one. Shouts from everybody. Silence soon after except for the guns. Broken slumber for the rest of the night.

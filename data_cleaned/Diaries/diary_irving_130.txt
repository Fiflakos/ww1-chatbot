Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 24 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. Jun. 24, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Observation balloons up on hill. Sgt. McGay absent. No fuss. Over with promptly. Newsman blows his welcome horn. It is a message from civilization that he brings. It makes breakfast more enjoyable to sit down as of old to eat and read the news of the day. Police around bunk and make a hurried cleanup of my gun. Lt. has threatened an inspection. I must not give him the opportunity to make good his threat of yesterday that a man found with a dirty gun will receive an appointment to the white wing squad of the town. We, who remember that, look at Lenehan and laugh. Breakfast, plenty. Bacon, bread, Karo, coffee. As usual, I absent- mindedly place plate containing syrup where it will drip. I lose a good portion of it, which glues up straw bedding. I spend ten minutes with my gun cleaning outfit. Kaplan asks me if I am on guard duty for to-day. No! He wants me to report to Cpl. Haight for a "soft job". I have no faith in that. Rather think I am called to answer for having written to the boys is such a peculiar strain. Come what may it is best to wash. Maybe I can charm away officers' anger with my neat appearance. I hurry as much as possible, reporting to Cpl. Haight, while all officers are in Orderly Room. I am to be orderly for the day he tells us. Lt. C. displeased with Kaplan's choice, very evidently. My duties begin at once and consist of waiting outside for half an hour, then sent to Battalion Hdqrs. with papers, returning to Haight with others. Run to ask Lt. a question, once more to Batt. Hdqrs. and my morning's work is done. I get back to billets for a newspaper and a French Grammar belonging to Havens to help while away the time. The slowest, sleepiest job in the world. Bugle blows every fifteen minutes it seems, warning of an aeroplane overhead, which must be obeyed by getting under cover to prevent pictures from being taken, or hurt coming to anyone accidentally from dropping shrapnel. Fritz is overhead early but is quickly driven away. One of our planes is dodging back and forth over the lines, being shelled constantly. He goes through the morning's program safely. I admire his nerve and coolness. Rumours of heavy losses among Co. C last night. Officers and Co. clerks have it. I believe it is true, because it is uniformly the same from many sources. Rather worries us. Major especially. Go to mess a little ahead of time, finding 15 minutes to write. Mess. Soup, fit for a Duke's table, pork and beans, bread, coffee. I had a few nuts previous to dinner, making a meal which fills me up to the neck, a heavy feeling resulting. Back to my bench by the brook to study French. I do that all afternoon. Not a single errand until 4 o'clock, when Captain sends me to hunt up Lts. to tell them he wishes to meet them at once to go over sector with them. I pick strawberries on my way back. Large, juicy, red ones. Handfuls of them. Aviators take an afternoon off. So do gunners. A lazy, restful afternoon spent in wishing I were prepared to write and in study. Supper comes and with it another errand to my barracks. Men are lined up getting new caps, wrap leggings, 2 prs., socks, a shirt, if one has been lost, and a stick with two small pieces of wire gauze, purpose of which we do not know. Suggest it can be used as a fly swatter. Dress up in our new trappings immediately. Pleased with myself. Supper, for which I have no desire, is again very good. Bully beef stew, jam, bread, coffee. Report back for duty in Orderly room. A crowd around infirmary next door. I look upon a pitiful sight, French soldiers brought in from the lines, tear-gassed. They are in great pain. Eyes swelled, red- 183lidded, tearing in a steady stream, totally blind temporarily. Coughing, vomiting, some burned about the legs and arms too. They are led indoors by a brother soldier. Follow meekly, suffering in silence, answering questions put to them by men convalescing from slight wounds, obediently. Tell how it came about. Women in street look on and cry. In all about a dozen cases brought in. One, a woman, comes on foot from a nearby place, for treatment, led by a man. That affects me more than anything else I have seen. Shame that a woman, a noncombatant, should be exposed to injury and death. When ambulances have ceased bringing in their toll of wounded I am asked to distribute mail for the company. I look anxiously for letters. Disappointed again. Very few letters. Some newspapers and magazines. I am besieged by everybody waiting to hear from home. Back to my post where a discussion of gas brings up question of how long we can hold our breath. A competition which I lose. Haight makes a remarkable record of 1:4O. I study French for another hour. Seat myself beside Sgts. on bench going over events of the day. Another ambulance full of gas cases pulls in. Some minor injuries among them in a second car. Woman returns for treatment. She must live very near at hand, in which case this town is in greater danger than we thought, from hostile gas or shell attacks. Captain and Lts. return from sector. I wait a few minutes before going in to ask if I am needed, as I am told to do by Haight. I intrude upon their supper. Lt. Cook looks at me as though I were most despised criminal, but I pay no attention to him. Told that I am not needed. Back to quarters at once to write. Sunset is the signal for an aeroplane sortie by Fritz. Town takes cover. Antis try to wing him without success. He is driven away, having done no damage. I write till 10:30 by candlelight. Heavy guard posted to be alert for gas and air raids. Major directs that gas masks are to be kept close at hand. Some men discussing possibility of getting orders to go up in reserve at night. I do not think it possible, judging from what Height told me, that we would remain for four or five days and then relieve H and E. Comparatively quiet to- night, both in and out of the barracks. Carefully roll up my leggings and go to bed. Sleep like a top. It is cool and quiet. An Army truck runs over the leg of an ox, breaking it. The calmest Frenchman I ever saw is the owner. He makes no complaint, swears at no one and apparently does not want indemnity in sum twice the value of his ox. Rumours of C Co. casualties confirmed by Doctor Trow.

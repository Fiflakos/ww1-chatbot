Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 30 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Jul. 30, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:30. Breakfast. Rlce with apricots, bread and Karo, coffee. Apologies by Kastner, F Co. Mess Sergeant for not being able to give me any breakfast and then he gives me as much as I want. The barrage, which started last night, is still going, apparently without having let up at all. I am anxious to know what the outcome of the fray is and also what organization is taking part in it. I inquire of the Sgt. if there are any formations for the day. None that he knows of until he inquires of the Lieutenant. Out of curiosity, I look at my shirts. In my OD I find a few cooties and also 249in my undershirt. What I cannot understand is how they can breed so quickly in clothes that have been deloused by the disinfecting process. It must be the billets that are at fault. They are four or more years old and have probably never been cleaned, or policed properly. The French are not for such things. Search my blankets but in them I can find no trace of lice. Hang them outside to air. Clean out the dust and straw from my bunk and shake shelter tent halves well. The Sergeant has Corp. Thurn, Ellenbogen and two others go out with him and the Lieutenant to show the men of 145th, who relieve us, the positions of posts and limits of sector. All those men, who were not to delousing station yesterday, go to-day. They are given the password but are cautioned not to stay away "too long". They are expected back after mess. The reason is that at any moment we may get an order to pack up and move. The crop of rumors in regard to our destination is not very abundant this morning. No one has any brilliant ideas. Nothing original. Get in to my bunk to write. It is hard. Move about in an attempt to find comfort. Try lying down, sit up, move to this place and that. So I accomplish very little up to dinner time. The best rumor of the day is a rumor that we have a good dinner. It is true. We have potato, meatballs, bread, coffee. The meatballs are plentiful. I get another without having to resort to a ruse. The other fellows have more than they can eat, some of them having gone up to the mess shack three times. After dinner there is no formation and the afternoon we have to ourselves. I see a newspaper for the first time in weeks and learn of the death of John Purroy Mitchell, our former Mayor. It surprises me more than shocks me. I have so far permitted myself to get out of touch with the world, so that I know of nothing that is going on. All the news I get is hearsay news from the other boys. In the same manner I receive news of the death of the Roosevelt boys in an aeroplane accident. I am growing tired of this place for that reason. We see too little and get too little from the outer world. Write a letter to Abe Gold outside. Go inside to write to Mike, one to Reggie and Mende, one to Leah. The boys who have been to the delousing station come back with new clothes. Even their outer garments have been sterilized. They have had a wonderful dinner with E Company, something that could never happen here. Their section party of 12 were fed with steak, potatoes, soup, bread, sliced tomatoes, lettuce salad. I can hardly believe that such a thing is possible in the army, but all the boys vouch for the truth of what they say was on their menu. Our sergeant has told F Co. kitchen earlier in the morning that twelve of his men will come in for dinner a little late and asked him to save mess. When the boys come in they are told that mess is waiting for them. They are not sure whether they are able to eat another meal but they will try. Strange to say, the mess sergeant is generous with them and offers them as many as 4 or 5 meatballs. They refuse to take them, which must be as much of a surprise to the sergeant. A big day of eats for Black who is always hungry. Nothing else of interest occurs during the afternoon. It is quiet. The officers are busy going over maps and orders with their successors. Men from the companies are all but on detail, fixing roads or digging trenches. Finish all my letters before supper time, except the one for Leah. I am tired. Take a half hour's nap and then have supper. Stew, bread, coffee. The mess sergeant is watching the line. He has discovered that some "wise guys" have put one over on him. He is hoppin' mad. He threatens to report those who beat him out of a few meatballs, which he might have thrown away. Surprised to find no one whom he recognizes. After supper sit on a box to finish Leah's letter. There is Streetor and another who are writing, too, and want me 250to prompt them in spelling. I help them a lot. Many easy words cannot be spelled by them. Growing dark. Write in my bunk by candlelight. Everybody is in good humour to- night in spite of the fact that Wade, the ringleader, has not had much to drink. The boys in the lower bunk complain about my light. I pay no attention to them. Protest that in every other billet there are lights lit. There is a little surprise in store for us to-night. A Boche plane, perhaps more than one is up over us. Order for lights out in our billet is immediately obeyed. I lie on my back, anxiously wondering what will happen. We are afraid that plane will drop bombs, because there are so many lights in the woods. Plane circles about for more than 15 minutes and nothing is done to drive him away. Not a gun is fired at him. No planes of our own are up. The nearest aviation field is 38 kilos away and it is probably difficult to send a machine or two up on short notice. There is excitement when the first few shots from an anti-aircraft gun are fired. The Boche must get away in a hurry and to do this he must lighten his cargo and drops 4 bombs. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! behind our camp. Many of the boys get out of their beds and run to the door. It looks like a stampede for a time. Streetor and Farrell and a number of others keep their heads and shout for the men to remain in their bunks. Everybody takes up that cry and the men come back and get into their bunks. Fritz goes on. We can hear him directly over our heads. Persistent in his purpose. A mile or so ahead of us he drops eight more. They are not very large bombs, but they rock the ground considerably. Some of the men think that the reports we hear are from big guns. That is good, as it quiets some of our men. Fritz seems to be coming back. He is circling back again, over and around us. Lying on my bunk I try to think what it is best to do. I hate to think of a bomb dropping right into my bunk. I turn on my side, so that I cannot see it come. More nervousness, nothing else, for I realize that it is absolutely futile to do anything but lie where we are, for if I run, I may run into a bomb or a piece of shrapnel. Tallon comes in at this point. He talks as though there was no bombing. Soon after the sound of the aeroplane ceases. Sleep well after that. The boys resume their story-telling for a while. I watch for a while. Tallon grinds his teeth all night. Gillece is hurt in a barrage of cans, soap, paper, etc. His eye is cut. It bleeds considerably.

Author: Frederick Harold Tubb Date: Tuesday 08.06.1915. Nationality: Australian. Egyptian Gazette thismorning gives particulars of anotherbig scrap at the peninsula on the4th inst. Two boat loads of ourwounded came in yesterday. Hearthat Lt Bollon's bro is wounded &that Lt Campbell (who went backon the Australind with Col Ellioton the 26th ult) was killedThe reports received here so farare that they have been having a particular hell similar to whenwe first attacked. Hear that CaptJess is our Bde Major now; Our Bdereturned to Lemnos for two days onlywhat is left of them are at the GallopoliHaving inspection of rifles today. There is fear of an uprisingof the natives and it iswell to be quite prepared foranything. There are coast guards& patrols in all villages butthey are mostly Egyptians. Thenatives have altered somewhatlately. Seeing & hearing of thelarge numbers of our woundedseems to have lessened theirfear of us? Capt Dobbie QM.8thBn came out to see Bolton. Dobbie camefrom the Gaba Tepe last Saturday heis invalided for a minor complaintHe told us much news of the frontsays that our Brigadier called someof the Bde men names etc etc& that Bde Major Cass at Cape Hellesmade a remark or two etc etcThe Royal Marine Light Infantries& the Drakes (the naval division(Territorials) did not shine out likeour men (that is to put is mildly)Our men were ordered to "push on" "Push on" by Senior officers thoughmuch against the will & wishes of theirown officer (who is seems had muchbetter ideas) It bewilders one, hearingthe different views of different officersDobbie states that our line ofdefence is quite safe at Gaba Tepethat when he left we had 15 mento the yard & a machine gun to 10 yards& a field gun to 20 yards right along our line ofdefence. Our reserves are only 1000yards from the firing line, oursupport only 10 yds from the frontIt is worse as the reserves thanon the front trenches he saysas regards shell & shrapnell fireWe have a number of Japanesetrench guns (mortars) which firea shell in a lob a few hundredyards the shell is equivalent toa 6 inch gun. but the gun used is alittle short one. The generalbelief is that the Australiansadvanced too far the firstday at Gaba Tepe. Thoughour Bn officers did not want tothey were ordered to by superiorofficers although the G.O.C.'sorders were to stop andentrench on the first ridge as our C.O. & other officers of theCompanies and platoons wanted to doThe belief expressed by many whowere present is that had westopped & dug in on the first ridgewe would not have lost more than10% of what we did! 7pm Have heardthat 6 more ships have had ordersto fit out as hospitals & go to GallopoliReport says that 16000 casualtieshave occurred the last few daysThe food & clothing suppliesat the peninsula are plentifuland good, the Issues of cigarettestobacco rum etc are given out everyday, plenty of good blankets & storesalso are there. Though there hasbeen complaints re the medicalarrangements & treatment of woundedin the majority of cases the serviceis good One cannot & shouldnot expect everything perfectin a show like this. The heavycasualty list, the disorganizationbrought about by same. The hugetask, & the breaking down ofelderly superior officers etc etcI am filled with wonder at theirpower & magnitude of the BritishEmpire & the way thing continue despite the thousands of thingsthat tend to disorganise & demoralize.One has only to viewthe shipping, the Navy the ArmyThe transport Commissarial etc etc. The gigantictask being attempted, & thinka bit & he is amazed that thehuge concern is progressingso well as it is. "It's a long wayto Tipperary" or Constantinople forthat matter, or to Berlin either Imthinking eh? what!

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 16 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Aug. 16, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Suffering from effects of gas Up at 8, nauseous, eyes glassy and red, throat sore and lungs congested, no appetite. Cough and blow my nose continuously. Weak in general. Little ambition to roll my pack and hike with it on my back. Wash and shave, which helps freshen me a bit. Go scouting about for a cup of coffee, which is all I care to eat. Our kitchen has none. They have received no ration and will have cabbage and potatoes from native garden in about an hour. I roll my pack so that I can take with me to Batt. Hdqrs. an overcoat, slicker, towel, toilet bag, my sweater. The rest is in my tent half. Have a hard time to eat my mess. At 11, everybody ready to start for the farmhouse, where we will stop for dinner. Fritz is quiet all morning. He has done very little while out in this area. Difficult for me to climb the hill to the farmhouse. My wind is extremely poor. I am afraid I will decline rapidly from now on, according to what I have been told of the effects of gas. Take off my pack in the E Co.'s kitchen, where I get a slice of bread with butter and a cup of hot coffee, which is sufficient for my dinner. I am urged to take steak and other things, but I have no appetite. I am told that during the night Fritz put a shell into the barn, where E Co.'s work detail was asleep and blinded two or three of our men and put fourteen of them in the hospital. Varying reports of the damage done. I go to the infirmary where I am treated. I am given a drink of ammonia and water, some ammonia to inhale. My eyes bathed with a solution of bicarbonate of soda, which is also applied to a few burns on my face. See one man terribly blistered from the mustard gas, all over his body. In five minutes I feel fresh as a daisy. I expected to be sent to the hospital. The doctor wants to know if I am blind. As long as I can see I am fit for duty. The men wait impatiently for me. I go back to the kitchen, taking off my mess kit carrier from my pack and with that make into a bundle the other things I mean to carry into the lines with me. A bulky load, not very heavy. We are off. I know the way better than the others. Levine, Mac and Doherty put me in command. That leaves me in a state where personal fear is entirely forgotten. I have the lives of others on my hands. No time for thoughts of self. Not a shell from Fritz all the way up the hill to the woods. Lead the men 287safely through the woods. There we halt for a rest. Doherty white with fear. Mac nervous. I am quite calm. Across the field as quickly as I can travel, without a mishap or incident. Rest in a funk hole. Two runners with a message come down. There is a post two or three holes further on, where the message is delivered for relay. I permit the relay to get away first. I follow with my command. Past the dead horse and the spilled beans before Fritz spies us and sends a few shells for us. His range is long. With the first one, I hug the earth, with the second we run into the bushes. The men huddle together. I order them to spread out. Put my bundle on my back to act as a shock absorber if fragments fall on me. It is a foot thick of cloth, excellent for the purpose. Fragments fall close to us. Since his range is long, I want to move forward. I collect my brood and we run down the hill past the dead men, entirely out of range. Almost fall where the water overflows. Afraid Fritz will get us at this point with machine gun fire. Do not stop until we are safe in our dugout. Only three men are there. Headquarters have moved down the street. The three men present are very sick. The Major is just sent to the hospital. He is in a bad state. Every member of the Hdqrs. detachment has gone or is going to the hospital. All of E Co.'s scouts and many others. Only ten of us left, including we three, who just came. All of H Co. but 2 men are in the hospital. Many casualties from shell fire during the night and day. Griffiths and Capt. McMurtry running the Battalion. Griffiths in bad shape. He hangs on gamely. The bravest man I ever met. I am wringing wet all over. If gas were to come now, I would be burnt to a cinder. Fan myself to dry a bit. There is cold coffee and bread to eat on which a billion flies have already feasted. The Major has left behind a bundle of cigars which we sample. Lie down in the dirt in an effort get some sleep. Lt Griffiths comes in to get two fresh men to go with him on a mission. G Company platoon and Hdqrs. is ordered with Colonel to move up on the heights to get out of this hole where the gas hangs so long. We must reconnoiter for a position, dangerous work in the daytime. Doherty tries to get out of it, but the Lt. orders him to follow. We run through the streets and up the slope under the shelter of the brush and woods. In a short while my lungs are ready to burst. I pant so, must lie down to rest. Whole body heaving. Up three terraces where we find a suitable spot for the retreat. Rest there and return to our quarters faster than we came up. Not a shot fired at us. We must wait until dark and orders to move. Wetter than before. Beg that the candle be put out to get relief from the flies. Doherty makes life miserable with his nervous worries about the light and the curtain. Lie down on a chaise lounge. A little after dark the liaison platoon of G comes trooping into our dugout, where it is pitch dark and no one can see. The seething mass sit on each other and curse in all languages. I am far away from my equipment at the other end of the cellar. Lt. comes, orders us up. I make a frantic effort to get my things, tiring myself out completely, even before I start. Lt. leads a quick march up the hill. Soon he drops back to let Doherty guide the column up. I press forward. We halt the men on the 2nd terrace by mistake. Then move up one more. String out men and tell them to dig in. Lt. comes and changes plans, taking all of the men into the little hollow intended for Hdqrs. We begin to dig in. Revel in a pile of dung. My imagination plays tricks. Think I am digging my grave or disturbing the grave of another. Not five minutes after the task is begun we are shelled. He must have seen us in the moonlight overseeing the orchard. He fires short. Fall prone as each shell comes hissing towards us. Steel drops a foot away from us twice. Then the Lt. calls me. Wants me to go back to the village to Hdqrs. to wait for a 288ration detail. Take another man with me to bring back two G men for the purpose of acquainting them with position so they can form a liaison group. I go back for my coat and arms. Hesitate a moment before I return to the Lt. which saves my life probably, for had I been that much further advanced on my return to where he was I would have been struck squarely on the head by a pound piece of steel. Say a prayer of thanks. Lt. cautions me to duck when I hear a shell coming. I do not heed his warning. I run and flop alternately. It is getting hot. Make the village in safety. Fill up my canteen at the pump. Man looking for aid for an engineer, badly wounded. Two ambulances ready to take casualties out. Argue with my companion in center of the street, ordering him to proceed with his mission, which he will not do. I get into a dugout as three shells explode behind me, sending a shower of debris into the door and down the steps after me. A barrage of at least a thousand shells follows H Co. and plenty of gas. The town and the whole hillside is raked by the fire, shaken up considerably. My mask on and off. The ration detail comes to report. Later Lt. Griffiths, who brings down a party of L. Co., which has taken up a position near us on the hill, for water. We go to Batt. Hdqrs. Lt. arranges about rations. An E Co. detail tells me Atha and Kinlen have shot themselves while cleaning their pistols, slight foot wounds. I am left behind to bring an E and F man up in morning. Glad to be left, where there is shelter. I tell of my experiences to a sergeant, not knowing that Lt. Godfry and Captain of the 3rd Batt. are asleep there. There is occasion for them to wake up. A conversation follows which I will remember for the rest of my days. Try to help them but they do not take my advice. I lie down to sleep on a mattress. Sleep for three hours, soundly. Sergeant kind enough to give me something to eat. There is plenty of ration but difficult to carry it in the lines. Lt. Cook comes in looking like a lunatic. He was up in the hill with Hdqrs. They were shelled out and wounded soon after I left or as soon as the company took on position. Lt. Case badly wounded with other men and Lt. Guerst was killed. Most everybody shell-shocked and he fears for the safety of Lt. Griffiths and Capt. McMurtry, who were with him. The men had to move to another sector unknown to us. I am worried.

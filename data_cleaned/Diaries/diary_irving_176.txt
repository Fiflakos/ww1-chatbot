Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 10 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Aug. 10, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Hike 3 kilos to ........ . Go about 70 kilos in motor lorries and hike a kilo and a half to outside ........ Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Hash, biscuits and coffee. Told to roll our packs by 10:30, which gives us plenty of time. Wash and get to work at once on my pack. This time it is lightened by being minus a tent pole and pin, which I have loaned to Gardiner. Made heavier by the addition of an overcoat, which the Lieutenant has finally convinced us we should carry. Black goes to the company supply sergeant and brings back one for every E Co. man. To- day, we have a heavy burden to carry, taking into consideration the 160 rounds of ammunition which we must cling to. My pack ready, I write for an hour. The time of moving has been postponed for an hour. At 11 we form and march into town, having previously eaten a bit of biscuit and some hash. E Co.'s men and officers are in the town square waiting for the command to march. About 2/3 of the company go up the line; the rest remaining behind to look after supplies or something of that sort. The kitchens remain behind also. They cannot be taken along to- day. The cooking will be done in a few dixies which are taken on the truck. Major in the square as neat as a pin, on horseback, issues the order to wear tin helmets for which he is heartily sworn at. We go at head of column. Fall out as usual, a few hundred yards down the road to say a little more in praise of the Major. Griffiths is becoming very strict with us. We are beginning to grouch with him, too. Hike to the crossroads in the hot sun, where we see a line of trucks as far as the eye can reach. The first battalion already embarked, 16 272men to a lorry. For a time we do not notice the lorry drivers. Then I discover that they are Chinese coolies. It strikes me as funny to be driven by them. There are two to each lorry, stupid leering individuals. We all wonder how they were ever taught to drive. We go up the road past hundreds of lorries. That train and its drivers is a thing of record. We go uphill till it seems the Major will never halt, then after a little rest we do squads left about and walk down hill in column of twos, are counted off in groups of 16, by the French loading authorities, and are packed into tight quarters. Our equipment takes up all floor space. We sit on benches along the sides and 4 men on the tail board. We amuse ourselves at the officers' expense. Then we begin to think of eats. Everybody is hungry, and there are apparently no preparations being made to feed us. We are sorry we have not taken tinned meat and biscuit with us. Doherty tells a Frenchman of our plight and we get a half a loaf of bread from him. It disappears as if by magic. Wait impatiently for the train to start. Every one of the many cars is filled to capacity. It is now a question of providing for the officers. They are bundled into a large lorry. The Major rides in a Ford with the adjutant. Orders given to go, the lorries crank up while we wonder if our lives are safe in their hands. They are off with a safe interval between cars. They go like hell, giving us an awful bumping. We are given to understand that it is a five hour trip to where we are going. Pass through ........ where we are given a hearty cheer by the women. Soon the men on the tail board are white from the road dust. They are queer looking men with white hair, eyelashes and a coating of dust on their noses and around the mouths. In the car it is not so bad, but my eyes and nose smart considerably. We find that these coolies can drive lorries. The train stops outside of ........ to let a railroad train pass. We get off and run into an orchard, which we quickly denude of green apples. I get enough to give everybody in my car some. They sharpen my appetite. We clamor for something to eat until McLeary and Deys, who have many biscuits as their iron rations, give then up, one to each man. We want more. Going through hilly country now, all sown in grain most of it cut or being cut. All Short stops along the road made where there is nothing to eat to be had. Above ........ which has the marks of the Hun's work on it, and is a pretty busy town, there are signs of German occupation. In one place the forest has been cut down, for the manufacture of wire stakes of which there are hundreds of thousands. Cross the ......... and see lines of trenches, shell holes and battered forests. Down into a beautiful valley. German billeting and direction signs in ....... . Cross the ........ at ........ . The scenery is as pretty in my estimation as along the Hudson at home. Beautiful villages once, as many on the other side of the river, some of them more fortunate than others, but most of them ruined. There are many rich men's houses of modern construction of varicolored stones and concrete. American troops quartered in ....... which is large enough to have had a trolley car. The men are at mess. We tell them we are hungry and they hold up their mess tins to us as we pass and snatch their bread. See our artillery, ready to move at instant notice, on tractors. Ask a quartermaster truckman to throw us a can of salmon, which he does. We are not faring so badly for food after all. We are fortunate. A hillside scene beyond comparison on the road to ....... . A vineyard on the slopes in a semi-circular formation of many kilos. Our men all along the route now. We exchange greetings. In ........ a once wealthy and beautiful city damaged beyond repair. Outside the city are the battle fields with a million shell holes, splintered trees, abandoned ammunition, graves, in the fields and by the roadside. We are all sore and stiff 273from bumping. Everybody has a headache. Black very sick. My box of crackers is stolen and eaten. An aviation field on what was only recently German ground, where are their graves and sign posts. Many of our men and machines. We stop on the road. Run over to take a look. A wonderful engine in those I see. They are much smaller than I imagined. All American made. One is trying out its motor. Find that we were being convoyed by aeroplane all through our trip. Pilot getting a relief here. Through ....... and ........ which the Boche has just left. A church smashed to pieces, one of the finest in France; the clock is still going. Next along the battlefield is ......... which proves to be our destination. It is dark as we pull in. A large town, an important one in the recent operations. Surprised to find a few women and civilians about. I cannot imagine where they can live. The streets choked with soldiers. We beg two big loaves of bread and from one shop obtain a can of peaches. March off to our billets, which no one knows how to locate. We turn about in the narrow street. I can see no place where we might sleep indoors. The men ask questions which we answer and we in turn get news of the day's operations and answers from them. We march out of town. Here only 20 kilos behind the lines are men without even a mask on them, which makes us laugh. See the Colonel. Ordered not to muster. The railroad station and tracks destroyed. We stumble and trip over men in the dark. Hear distinctly the sound of an engagement, see the flashes of the guns and the slowly rising flares and artillery signals. Take a very circuitous route to our unknown resting place. Every five feet a shell hole. That is something new. The smell of rotting dead, improperly and hastily buried, or parts of bodies not buried at all. A frightful, fearful thing in the dark. We hold our noses and turn about but the stench comes from all sides. Every few yards we get a whiff of it. And here we will sleep. Turn into the woods and are told to pitch our tents. I have no pole or pins. Shout for Gillece to come and bunk with me. A long time finding him in the dark. We are not permitted to use lights, an order which is disobeyed by those who have them. I look up into the starlit sky and wonder what will happen. Unroll my pack and with Gillece, make up our bed, two slickers and tent halves on the ground and two blankets and overcoats for covering with our coats on. Gillece has a box of crackers which are eaten. Doherty comes up to join us. Men go for dry rations. We get a can of hash and some hardtack for the three of us and fill our bellies before we get under the blankets. A faint stench greets our nostrils occasionally. We sleep with dead men. Shrapnel under my bed and pillow. The sky lit up by flares and the flash of guns. There is a constant rumbling and booming in the distance, not very far from us, much more than at any of the nights we have spent in the ........ sector or the positions we held around ......... . There is probably another gain made by our men. Artillery fire is as constant as in a barrage. Surprised that no guard is stationed around. We have no definite knowledge of how long we will stay here. And, as I have said here before, I have become an admirer of the coolies. They are good workers and generous in the extreme. Theirs is a job of hardships, which they bear smilingly. We have much less spirit than we began with, after observing activity here.

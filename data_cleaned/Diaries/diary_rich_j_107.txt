March 15th."Reconnaissance."Subject prepared for after dinner lecture by officers:--Aeroplanes play such a valuable part in reconnaissance workat the present time that patrole or scouts parties have not thesame scope, or is their so much need for their endeavours, with airphotography developed to so remarkable and reliable point. Nevertheless,there is yet a whole lot of personal work that company or- 19 -battalion scouts will be required to do, more especiallywith the possibility of semi-open warfare.Infantry scouts work on foot and usually operate nearthe force to which they belong. The value of the work donedepends largely upon the orders they receive; a speciallydefined objective must be given them, and it will be impressedupon the scout leader the actual questions he will be expectedto answer upon his return. Scouting parties will avoid combatwith the enemy as far as possible but they must be preparedto fight at any moment. They should be sound physically andin good condition. Be able to form sound conclusions fromsigns, such as clouds of dust footprints etc. Understand thevarious forms of signalling and give in consise reports aswell as sketches showing full detail.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 22 December 1917. Location: Barracks Camp Uptown. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. Dec. 22, 1917 Weather: fair, windy Up at 6:00. Reveille 6:15. Breakfast, steak, oatmeal, bread, coffee. Clean up for inspection of barracks. 8:00. To theater site with overalls and shovels. Shoveled manure out of trench, mixed concrete, shoveled sand, carried lumber. I become expert at the art of loafing. Blew up cold. Slush freezes. 12:00 back for mess. Letter from Leah. Name posted for going home 10:30 train Sunday. Mess. Veal, potato, peas, cocoa. Read. Loafed. Played pool. Called up Leah. Was very restless thinking of home and three day vacation. Supper, meatballs, potatoes, coffee. Read in bed. Make bed. Washed leggings. Received package from Dolly. Played auction pinochle. Lost. Went to bed at 9:00. Very uncomfortable, sore, restless. Throat sore. Tonsils swollen. Noise all night. Had bad dreams and got little sleep. Eyes sore. All day long thought of nothing else but home I did nothing whatever that was of any value. So abandoned that I played pool and cards to kill time. Was interested for few minutes only. Then my thoughts would wander to home and Leahs joy at seeing me and my joy at seeing her and how I would loaf and sleep and smoke.

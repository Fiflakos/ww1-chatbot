Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 7 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Jul. 7, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Poor Find my first cootie in my shirt. Eat my sandwich and when the next patrol is out, I get into one of their bunks to finish a night's rest very much broken up. At 3:00, I hear the dull boom of a distant barrage to the right. Not quite sure of it, seems more like I am dreaming. At four o'clock I am awake ready to go back to quarters. No message of any kind to take back to Lt. Not tired. Stomach easy. Back without incident. Smell of mustard again. Lt. awake when we enter, helping Sgt. make out report. It appears that he has been up all night. Still he is in his usual good humour. Report verbally about what has happened. Asks about barrage sent over at 3. Tell him it was at our left, in error. Correct myself as best I can. Gillece is sent to Batt. Hdqrs., while I lie down to sleep until breakfast. Awake at 8. Sgt. shows me a note written by Lt. ordering me to report to work squad. He tells Act. Capt. of F Co., in charge of detail, it is his honest opinion I am being punished wrongfully for some one's mistake and requests him to be lenient with me. Nevertheless, I am sore at heart at the thought of having to undergo punishment, and that, to protect others. I must take it without complaint and have a black mark against my record. I am not willing to go even under the easy conditions of Lt.'s note and say so, earnestly. Sgt. of course, has his hands tied. He sympathizes with me, as do all the men, and many a threat of revenge is uttered against the men who wronged me. I go for breakfast. Eat little and in silence, feeling like a whipped youngster. Argue that I will take a court-martial in preference, but for Lt.'s sake I do not press on that tack. Ask if it would be expedient to report sick, which for my own sake, I really should do, thereby getting out of punishment by a technicality. Now that I want to be sick, I feel fairly well and I cannot feel honest if I do report sick. I want to see Lt. once more before I go. I can see him at the window, shaving. I wait until he has finished, but when I get upstairs he has mysteriously disappeared. I become moody. Try Sgt.'s patience while I attend to toilet with a lot of needless fuss. Begin to roll my pack in full view of them all. Not until I am almost finished does Sgt. tell me it is not necessary. I am going but to Hdqrs. of F, to report to either Lt. or Sgt. Much cheered at that and am up and off in a hurry. We get to ........., which is the route Sgt. wishes to take to destination, but I dissuade him and get him to go by a good road with me. I am under the impression that we are bound for road at right of 12. When there, Sgt. finds ground unfamiliar. He wants to go to the left. It is a puzzle how to get there from where we are at present. We must go uphill and downhill by roads and steps cut into side of hill, until we get to the foot, in the gully where our imaginary German stronghold is. We are at the extreme left of the path described by Capt. Mills. There are shell holes galore and I can easily see that Capt. Hills must he right in his surmise. We are to the best of my knowledge in No Man's Land, a plain target for snipers. If Sgt. is not afraid, I will not be, but I caution him not to go too far. I finally convince him we should go uphill 208again and to our right. He accedes and in a few minutes we find our post, but no Sgt. or Lt. They are at French Hdqrs. We make the tortuous journey through the boyau, sweating and bumping my head as usual, only to find that they are not there either. In ........ at F kitchen perhaps. Sgt. has been there but not now, so he is sent for and brought to us. What a long time it has taken to bring a culprit to his punishment. Now that I am here, there is not work to do. Cheered again by the thought that Major's order is being obeyed, as it should be, merely having me report, to be dismissed, and remain at the service of Lt. Griffiths. Sgt. walks up to our quarters. Pottery is mentioned when we arrive at door, where 3rd battalion scouts are, while on a visit to the lines. They would like to go to the pottery with me to get a few souvenirs for themselves. I go with them to show them where to find what they want. Go there and bring back with us handfuls of same designs that I got yesterday. It is agreed that I have my dinner and report back to Sgt. at 1:30. I may mess and sleep where I have been during the week. Steak, potato, bread, coffee. Stomach rebels. Read newspaper, President's Fourth of July speech. Go to report for duty. Dismissed! Glory Hallelujah! For once the Army does things sensibly. I need not report to-morrow unless called for. Back to resort the glad tidings and tell Sgt. of course I want to do guard duty. Then I will wash my underwear and take a bath in the stream. The sun is hot and there will be lots of time for my wash to dry, Aeroplanes overhead make me nervous. Germans up far from me are being fired at. He may see me before I can take cover. One eye on him, and hurry bath. On my undershirt I find a cootie. Black helps me look for more. That is all I find. Hang clothes to dry. Upstairs to write a letter to Leah about yesterdays remissness and to-day's cootie. Steal the necessary paper. Finish Lottie's letter. Supper. I am cheerful. Feel like a member of our select circle should feel, cheerful, a good appetite too. Meat balls, bread, coffee, potatoes, sauce. Upstairs to write again. A voice from below calls my name. Sgt. Hammond. He wants me at 7:30 tomorrow AM. In the dumps again, mentally as well as physically. I get cramps. I had intended to remain awake until 12 when I go on gas guard, but instead I go to bed with miserable outlook upon things, sorry that I did not report sick. Worry until I sleep. Boys had to seek shelter in dugout twice during last night. At town fountain evidences of gas shells to be seen. In that part of town I can see a dozen new holes. Herman and Kandel, who were near where one strikes, are badly shocked. During day, much air activity. Hundreds of shells sent into the air. Heavy nose of one, a missile of death, if struck, falls outside our quarters. Shelling from our guns kept up all day at intervals. On the whole things are tranquil. F Co. and Frenchmen are coming back from their raid as I am on my way to quarters in the early morning. They have penetrated 700 yds. into German lines and found no one. One man says, Germans go home to their wives at night. One man accidentally shot in the arm by his own men.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 22 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. May 22, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Gaps in the line. Many heads too big to carry. Breakfast by a new system. Each platoon draws rations to be distributed by Sgts. Dry rations for all day, wet as they are cooked. This morning, rice, bread, coffee. The men will drill for an hour, then go for a bath. At 7:30, we meet and are given instructions to pack. Full equipment. Mess Sgt. refuses to give us rations. We report at meeting place. Hot as blazes. Limbers to carry extra blanket rolls and rations late in arriving. Our own Lt. induces Sgt. to give us some tea, tack, cheese and bully. Difficulty in obtaining water. The carts are empty and the supply they are just putting in has not yet been chlorinated. First aid man detailed to march with us induces water cart man to give us a pinch of brine to put into our bottles. Gillece has a bad hangover from last night. He fills his canteen with red wine. I am offered some, represented as fresh water. One mouthful is all I want. Two hours are consumed in arranging details and prevailing upon supply men to give us what we need. Off without blouses, two limbers trailing behind, at 11. An easy pace, but in the hot sun I perspire, so that sweat streams off my nose and gets into my eyes. Pack does not bother me much. Feet are in good condition. After an hour, 2 men, Gillece and Conway, feel the effects of yesterday's carousel. Fortunately, we are at our first resting place. The horses are fed. We fall out for more than an hour. Eat very little. Only a little bread, cheese and jam. A cemetery across the road from us. Only a few graves, one a pvt., who died on Christmas Day. Take a smoke and a nap. Off again for 50 minutes. Getting nearer to the guns. Our new home in sight. Men in camps about are on a battle discipline basis. Lines of communication and supply show the enormity of modern warfare. Halted while Lt. explains what we came here for and shows us area to be occupied by battalion when they come up. We must note position carefully, guide others later. Home not what I expected as yet. First of all we see a real trench. Beyond this is another. Between these, we will pitch our tents, cut wires to get in. Wait for wagons to come up, after we rid ourselves of pack and equipment. Pass supply and extra clothes to men on other side of trench and then distribute everything to owners. Pair off tenting. Gillece falls to my lot as mate. He is a fine fellow, but not desirable today. Arrange our things in tent. Build a narrow ditch for drainage around our new home. Get wood for a fire, make a fireplace, dig a latrine. Camouflage tents and a shelter for supplies made from branches. Walk to main camp, a quarter mile, to wash and get water for coffee and to fill our bottles. Unexpectedly British have rations for us, too. A cook volunteers. He makes excellent coffee and a surprise dish with bully beef. Hashes it and fixes it with bacon, bread. Take off my shoes and socks to cool feet. I write till 8:30. Guard posted. Corp. and Sgt. will take their turn too. Lt. gathers us about him. Cautions us to wear respirators at all times and in event of attack to give alarm. To bed at 10:00. Too much noise to sleep. Gillece snores. Fritz is very active. Artillery is our next door neighbor now. Air skirmishes are frequent. One right over us at 8, and another at 1 o'c1ock. Machine guns and shells work so close to us, they can be distinctly heard to whistle a greeting to us. Shells go by us with a prolonged swish, until we can see them burst with a flash of fire in the distance. There is very little danger of an enemy attack in this area, except an occasional gas shell. It is not hidden from us that we are from now on responsible for a sector of the battle front, which we will defend in the event of a general retreat to our point. It no longer occurs to me to liken battle at night to a distant Fourth of July celebration. There are two of our men in billets about, who came in during the day. They have news that Al Ferguson died in base hospital and has already been buried. This is told to us at sundown. I cannot believe it. Interrupt Lt. with my exclamation of surprise. I mourn his loss. A sunny spirit. During the night the guard catches two porcupines, taking them prisoner via an old tin can. Note a large cemetery and feel less affected than when I first saw one on way to ........ . Large number of men in quartermaster service seen, on road, and lorries. Softens my opinion of struggle somewhat. At least some will go back unharmed. Infantry men tell stories of hardship only.

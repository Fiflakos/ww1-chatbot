Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 12 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Jul. 12, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Fair Up at 7:00. Expect another dull, uninteresting day. Determined to get to Hdqrs. of Capt. F, with a tale of sickness and after go to ........ in search of some eggs and other things which I might eat. Have my breakfast. Toast, coffee. Wash, tidy and police up in quarters. Without a blouse, weather is so nice, go to Hdqrs. Capt. is asleep. 1st Sgt. is asleep. I am not going to disturb their slumbers, if I can help it. Ask Sgt. to tell either of them, at first opportunity, that I have called and reported sick. Return to quarters to get password from one of the men. I have it. Promise to come back with matches. Walk down the road feeling like a very happy and free person. It is delightful to feel the cool breeze blow against my forehead. My steel hat is off for comfort and my front collar button is open to let breeze play against my chest. Pine breath from the limbs on the camouflage screen by the road is more pleasant than perfume. Keep to the left in the shade. Walk slowly. I feel superior to other men of 216company. Perhaps they are working. I am resting and my time is my own. As free as my fancy. Walk jauntily as the spirit of my journey grips me. Bid good morning to those I meet on the road if they are worthy looking individuals. Guard does not halt me. He is polishing his bayonet. I tell him it is not necessary. I know the word and he lets me go by. In the YMCA no crackers. I am disappointed. Get chocolate, a newspaper, a can of pears, after which it occurs to me that I would like some matches. Then I see tobacco. I need that, and last, perhaps chewing gum will quench my thirst. I may need it for tomorrow. I have just learned today is Friday. Wrap my purchases in newspaper, which I forget and leave behind at first. Then go where I know Epicerie was, to buy some eggs. To my surprise the place looks deserted and upon inquiry I find that it is. All the civilians have been ordered out by the 14th and most of them have complied with the order. A few old women left. It must be very hard for them to tear themselves away from their homes, which they have loved for so many years. No use bemoaning the past, and I can spend my time to better advantage writing than chatting on about causes. I start back to quarters. I feel as though I have forgotten something. Yes, I have. Envelopes. I asked for them too and went away without them. Take 1 dozen, make up a new bundle and start off again. At the door I stop again. Something missing. Pears left behind. Now I have everything. Off once more. In the east end of town, it sounds like shelling was being done by Fritz. It is difficult to locate. Observers differ as to objective. Both sides of the road at the end of town are being hit. Dangerous traveling on road. I wait for a few minutes in the sentry box at town gate, from where I can get a good view of where the next shell strikes. It lands on the other side of the road from where we saw the last one land. Doubtful what he is after, also how to avoid him. The Colonel passes in a car. He goes on without hesitation. Gives me courage to go on. Before I make the next village another shell bursts. I duck my head as though that would save me from injury. Frenchmen staying close to stone barn for protection. As soon as I make it, I follow their example, while two more burst nearby, one ahead of us, one behind us. I think it is the puffy, gusty wind that is responsible for such a widely scattered group of hits. Two Frenchmen come up. They think it is safe to go on, after questioning. I follow them. We run to next shelter while Fritz reloads, single file, keeping in the shade. Rest in a doorway where is another lad who came from opposite direction. Two officers stop to read my newspaper. While waiting there, one strikes so close that I feel a slight shock and a half minute later a piece of shrapnel comes breaking through the trees, landing not 15 yds. from us. One Frenchman in the building has business in ........ He starts immediately after last explosion. I follow him. He runs. I do likewise. Aeroplanes up to check. One battery is retaliating. I hear the whistle of shells over us. Pace is too fast for me. I must walk. Decide to throw myself flat on the ground if I hear shell coming. I will have to listen carefully for them. I am making a noise, the wind is rustling the leaves of the trees. Our shells are flying. A little rested, I run again. Frenchman way ahead of me. Roofs of town in sight now. A most welcome sight. I am fooled once by our own shell. I crouch for protection against a low stone wall. Then I am safe at last. In the open, walk up to kitchen, panting for breath and very hot. Distribute what I bought among the men. My clothes all open to cool off. Tell them how cruel Fritz has been to me. He keeps it up. Our guns breaking up things on Fritz's side of the line. Lts., Sgts., and two French scouts, who were out on patrol (reconnaissance), are back with trophies. A 217Prussian Guard's cap with a bloodstain on it. Frenchman has many decorations. Lt. is nervous. We must all stay indoors while aeroplanes are up, yet he himself runs around. This morning his party was shot at by snipers. I make my own cocoa for dinner. Have a piece of good roast meat, bread, dates, pears and cocoa, a big dinner, which leaves no ill effects. The afternoon I devote to writing. First thing I do is to tear up letters I wrote yesterday and rewrite them. Morris Berger's, Morris and Annette's. My how the French gunners are pelting Fritz today! The sky is full of planes and shells go over without cessation all day. It does not disturb me. Nothing does until, to break the monotony of things, one of the boys starts making a jazz band of two drumsticks on mess cup, on mess tin, on a chair. I must stop. Read until supper is ready. I have a meat ball, bread and cocoa. Upstairs to read. Corp. Wager starts his jazz band working again. It is the funniest thing I have ever seen. A stick suspended on two chair backs, from which is suspended an iron ring, a cup, two bags of Bull Durham, why I do not know. It is good sport to see him working at his band. It is good music too. Boys help along by singing. They have a fine quartet and good solo numbers. The evening cannonading in full swing. I read the NY Evening Journal and the Saturday Evening Post until I grow tired. I do not want to go to bed so early. I fall asleep nevertheless, shoes on. Wake for a few minutes to remove my shoes and from then on get a full quota of sleep during the night. I have another dream about the shop. This time Haff is mixed up in it. He and I have the old Fulton Press in Luke Street. It is slightly changed of course. There is some disagreement about ownership. Funny things occur like in the movies, animated presses, self-setting type, etc. A patrol to go out some time in the morning, the official substitute for the large one scheduled for the Battalion to pull out tonight. Frenchmen advise caution, I believe. Much in praise of the French scout who has citations for bravery from 3 Generals and 1 Croix de Guerre. He is envied but not by me. A blue devil with him, really a dare devil. Growing tired of self- confinement. My bottom hurts. But in spite of it all, I would like to write more to Leah and the boys about my experiences. If I could have quiet and convenience, I might do something worthwhile. I debate advisability of writing a song as part of an entertainment for the Army, when the jazz band intervenes.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 3 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Wed. Jul. 3, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good We celebrate the Fourth of July Up at 5:00 to go down to company kitchen for rations. Get a hot cup of coffee to start off the day. Carry back a good day's grub. A picture from home of my mother and father is given to me. It has been in a bag, together with bundles of newspapers, for a number of days. Surprising how well preserved it comes to me. Wait in the kitchen, talking to the cooks and writing to Leah, until breakfast is ready. Bacon, bread, Karo, fried potatoes, coffee. Wall comes for the men. Two letters for me from Leah. I thought they were more of the missing ones, but no, it is new mail. Good news. A card from Hugo. Wash and police room. Prepare to go out to 12 post. Corps is expected to transfer there. Yesterday's post has been abandoned. On the way to the post I get four more letters. Three from Mama and one from Leah. Read them as I walk. Leah has received Govt. insurance policy. Lottie sends me news clippings about Yorkville celebrities. On road and up hillside, I see evidences of destruction from gas shelling. Never before have I noticed how it sears and burns the trees 200and grass. Get into 12 very easily. Thurn and Gillece with me. On post two men are awake and the remainder sleep. We do not disturb them, noisy as we are. The night has been very quiet. Nothing develops. On parapet and in outpost, one will watch in each. But, where are my glasses? I was sure I had brought them with me. I guess I have not taken them with me. I must wait till the others have done their tour of duty. In the meantime I sit down to wonder what has come over me of late. Every time I go out, I leave something behind. Observation is poor, that is, it is quiet ahead of us. Nothing can be seen. I relieve Gillece and fare no better than he. Position is an exposed one, from which it is easy to be seen by enemy observers. No support for the glasses, which must he held in the hand, a tiring job. While others observe, I write to Leah seated on a box in the entrance to the dugout, from which a strong draft issues. I quickly become chilled and must stop writing. On post again and alternate with Gillece until 2:30, when relief comes. At one time a Sgt. in H Co. looks out and believes he discovers a German observer in the gulley below. I take glasses and stick my head way over parapet in endeavor to see, but distinguish nothing in the tangle of twigs and branches. Very hungry and must encroach on rations of men in post for a bully beef sandwich. Thurn stays behind to continue his observations. Gillece and I return to quarters without a report of any kind to make. In a hurry for mess. Roast beef hash, potatoes, tomato sauce, coffee and bread. The afternoon is ours after we report to the Lt. I write until supper time. Hash again, bread, coffee. Of course I am not very hungry. A hint that the entire party will be asked to volunteer for a raiding party to go out with Lt. Cook. Write until 8, when Sgt. comes in to announce that if any one would like to go with him and Lt. they may volunteer to do so. No one is anxious to work with Lt. Cook, I by no means. Sgt. tells Gillece and me we must go, only to report to the Lt., stay there all night and bring back a report of the night's activities. Start out before nightfall, without the company of other men. The proposed raid, or whatever it is that was projected, has been called off. Dark when we get to headquarters. Told to make ourselves comfortable. It begins to rain. No comfort outside, Get into dugout. A queer scene. Exaggerated as a stage scene. Runners see officers leave for a little nap. Officers are supposed to be in the line with the men. Three of us sit on a bunk to chat. Begin to write. Runners fall asleep. I write, alone and in silence, until I finish a twenty page letter. Officers come in. Awake runners. I go into next room. Officers praise each other for their bravery. I reread letter, making a few corrections. Get as far as page 8. "Everybody out". I wonder why! Lt. Cook has always been a joker. I look at him again. He is in dead earnest. I carefully fold letter, put it away safely. Get my arms and helmet. Follow the others upstairs. I do not hear anything yet. Think it is foolish stand-to order that is to blame. It is as dark as pitch. We must feel our way. So dark that we cannot see our hands in front of us. At head of stairs, a step further, and my foot hangs in space. Feel about cautiously. Get on terra firma. Warn the next man about trench. It is Gillece who I ask to stick close to me. In my opinion it is best to stick together. Now I understand why we were ordered up. A machine gun spits a load of lead into the darkness. Pop, pop of rifles. Bombs. It opens up all over the line. I find myself shivering, my teeth chattering. Plant my legs firmly on ground. Stiffen up to quiet my nerves. Men beside me are complaining it is cold, because they shiver. I know better than they why. It is not cold. Cloudy and a mist is falling. We talk in whispers. I keep shouting to men to keep out of the trench. Told that I will be shot if I make a noise. I do not understand 201and continue to warn men, who tumble into the trench. Officers have disappeared excepting McDougall. I thought they had started to go to outposts. We are gathered in a knot and roll called. French Lt. is sent for. I hear him coming. Revolver in hand, ready to fire, I halt him. Recognized. I send for Bernard, interpreter. They converse. Lts. disclose their positions. They have been waiting to aid men, to quiet or direct us. My blood boils. Fighting grows more and more intense. Bombs are bursting and machine guns and rifles are working steadily. I, pistol in hand, still shivering, stand in silence, admiring the courage of our men, who for the first time under fire are displaying remarkable coolness. A barrage called for at our left. A little widely distributed shelling and the barrage is on. At first the shells pass over our heads, but with the first explosion that cannot be heard. At our backs, see a most wonderful sight. The houses lit up by the flash of the guns. What a noise. We must shout to be heard now. Is the other side replying to our fire? I try to listen. Cannot distinguish anything but bomb, rifle and machine gun. A few shells bursting in the woods, as a precautionary measure, to keep them from coming over. It rains harder. Orders being issued by Mac only. Cook is in dugout with Capt. Sturgis. Seems that battle makes the night lighter. I am ready to go out if I am sent. Shrapnel whizz around us at times. As each bomb or shell bursts, I duck my head, so that my helmet hides my face from injury. We must be on the alert for gas. He usually sends gas to back area. Powder smell is blown back to us by now. It will be difficult to detect gas if it comes. Barrage continues for fifteen minutes with telling results. He sends over only a few heavy shells, which apparently find a target in the town. Gradually, the bombing, machine gun firing and rifle firing grows less and less. The battle is over. Lt. comes up out of the dugout with a smile to Capt., saying we have won. The gang is all here. "My compliments". How does he know? We are told we may go downstairs. We remain where we are to talk about it. Pray that none of our boys was killed, but how can that be possible? I expect a big list of wounded and dead and that casualties will exceed C Co. See some men coming over crest of rise behind us. Take no chances. Tell men to be on lookout and halt the first man that shows himself. It is Stringer. How did he get there? I go down into the dugout. There is Rogers on officers' bench. His feet being bandaged. So, that is the first one. There must be many, many more. Stringer comes down, hatless, coatless, no gas mask, breeches and shirt in shreds, hands and face torn. He is wet from head to toe, shivering from cold and from shock. He had fallen into a shell hole on his way back to trench from where he was while on ambush patrol. 3 airplanes up over us, circling about, directing shell fire from behind lines.

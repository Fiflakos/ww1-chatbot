Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 7 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. Jun. 7, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good On hike. ... Kilometres to ....... Up at 5:45. Have slept soundly for an hour. Business of policing, trying to get water, eggs, milk, pitching tents, rolling packs. Make mine as short as possible today. Eat a raw egg, shave, wash while waiting for breakfast. Lots of tine for doing things in. No need to wake up so early. Some of the boys have an opportunity to get more liquor. Breakfast 8:00. Beef stew, bread, coffee. Heat of coffee revives me. I am almost numb from cold on awakening. Do not eat very much. Worst enemy on march is a loaded stomach. Police again. Get water. Bayonets issued. Kitchen packs up. Company formed, roll call taken. Two men missing. Bernard and Mason. Probably asleep in a barn somewhere, too drunk to get up. Lt. McAllister shakes hands with non-coms of 1st platoon and bids us goodbye. He leaves company as per RSO. A faint hope left that we will entrain. Dispelled at 9:00 when company moves off, going away from RR. A rather large village, picturesque but poor. British lorries abundant. See French trucks in numbers for first time. Colonel waiting for us at first turn. Go on up road for a few hundred yards. Halt and wait for Rgt. to assemble. Told it would be a long wait. Strange to say we complain. Why not permitted to sleep later in morning? Remove pack. Lie down in tall grass with blouse on, fall into a doze with sun shining hot upon me. Wake up in a sweat. Remove blouse but cannot fall asleep again. Feel somewhat refreshed. Still very weak. Find difficulty in breathing. Order to fall in. In coming down embankment, I lose my balance slightly and almost faint with effort to recover myself. Had we been given command to march, I could not have moved a step then. Wait for 1st Battalion to pass and 3 companies of our own. We go in rear of outfit. I sit down, which revives me. Off at 11. When I step it feels as if I walk on hot coals. Go on with great effort and resolve not to let smaller members of squad and company do better than I. Walk 30 to 35 minutes, fall out for 10. Second stop at 12 near a canteen. I can refresh myself with lime juice and some chocolate. Boys have time to get more drink. At roadside, here, is a machine shop built on trucks. Machines for all kinds of repair. Hike along dusty roads, through fields of poppies, sweet peas, corn, rye, wheat, red clover. We are coming to a downhill path. Till now road has been remarkably level. At our feet in the valley directly below us is a village. A steep hillside, sheep, a belt of trees, a chalk deposit. The most beautiful sight in France. An aviation field, beyond, smooth as velvet, lends charm to the picture. This is the village of ........ . One more lap and we walk into a pasture at finish, 2:30. Wagons pull up water carts, kitchens at our service in a few minutes. My greatest desire is to bathe my feet. No stream in sight. All dry from heat. A dirty ditch by roadside, full of leeches, the only water available, but we all take off our shoes and bathe in dirt and mud. What a wonderful relief. Cooling entire body, getting us back into good humor. Remove shirt and blouse, lie down in grass to wait for end of mess line. I am not hungry. All I want is a piece of bacon, hard tack and lime juice in particular. Cheese also given. I do not take any. Mess over, I lie down in grass again until 4:30. Assembly call blows. Fall in eagerly. We are all very well rested. I can walk without feeling blisters. Just before our first stop we come to a considerable stream, the first that I have ever been close to or walked over in La Belle France. It is so inviting that we all proclaim that we would have stood hardship of coming this far before lunch, for the pleasure of a swim in it. Not a hundred yds. further on is another, shallower, clearer, a waterfall to add to its charm. Rest to prepare for a long uphill stretch, gentle but continuous. E. Co.'s line halts outside estaminet. Boys want wine. She gives only a little milk and some water until money conquers her objections. Nearly 30 bottles of wine licked up in 15 minutes. Off again. Boys going well. I was afraid of those who drank. I push my body along, because little Himpler and Rubin on either side of me stick. One place, we come to road which forms a D semicircle. Instead of taking a cut uphill, across field along straight line of D, a well defined path worn by many feet, we go completely around. It occurs to Del Duca to sing "All Around the Mulberry Bush", which saves us from mutiny. Officers smile, proud that they have such a fine set of men. After our next rest, just as we can see homes through the trees, we pass one of the boys of F Co. lying flat at the roadside, face downward, his captain watching over him. Hear later that man died from bleeding heart. Pass through a short avenue of trees and town is outside. Perk up marching through town. We go without a stop into a field near edge of town and pitch tents. A procedure so rare for Co. E, noted for fuss, that it must be noted. I limp as best I can, pitch tent and lie down to rest. I must write. It is 1 hour to supper. May just as well do that. With aid of candle, I manage well. Mess. Bully and rice stew, coffee-red hot. Bathe feet in what water is left in my bottle and go to refill bottle. Cart has gone. Get a handful of figs from Pimpl. Divide with Rubin, bunkmnte, and fall asleep. I never rolled over once during entire night. An ideal space for our tent, slightly uphill. Passing through a town after noon mess, a gun is working havoc very close to us. We are aware of the rush of air after explosion. No airplanes noted during day.

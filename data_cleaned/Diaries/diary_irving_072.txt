Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 26 March 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Mar. 26, 1918 Weather: cloudy, cold Health: good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast. Shredded wheat, stewed apricots, cocoa. Police platoon room. To drill field. Close order drill till 9:30. Back to firebreak. Detail of men picked from Company to go to signal school. I am among them. Told to report to signal school every morning at 9:30. Go to Battalion Hdqrs. Report to Lt. Lynch. All members of signal class issued field glasses and compass, flag kit. Start for Drill field. It is cold without overcoats. Wind is chilly and penetrating. Pair off with Mendelsohn. Receive and send semaphore. Cohn instructing. I am proficient. I think I will like this work. Tiring to swing arms constantly. Lt. Lynch an excellent instructor. Not a bully, yet he has a remarkable command of men, a young man but one of experience. Look through field glasses. They are of improved type and unusually clear sight is possible. We are spread all over field. Assembled for game three deep. Tiring. Purpose of game to develop wind. Running is very important part of signal mans duty as explained to us in a little speech by Lt. when class forms. Much fun in game. It also demands quick thinking. Next lesson a method of running which is between a trot and a walk which it is said will carry a man great distance without tiring. Lt. demonstrates. We follow around ring. I tire very quickly. Wind is fair but muscles of legs hurt so that I must drop out. We all try to run as shown, only fair success. Hard to acquire. That ends session. Back to quarters. Dinner. Pork and beans, coffee, soup. Make packs and are told we will pitch tents in field. Heavy roll. More equipment than usual. Takes a long time for Company to get set and started. To field. Many tents pitched by other Companies. Much maneuvering to find suitable place. Ordered to pitch tents. A most interesting work. Like Arabs. Romantic. Bunkmate is an Italian who does not understand. Trouble to start him working. A two man business. Wind is very strong. Blows down tent before it can be pegged down. Some are blown down after they are pitched. I wonder how men can sleep in them. They are very insecure in my opinion. Hardly up when order to strike is given. Hurried by officers. Poor packs made. Uneven ground and make mistake of rolling alone. Back for Retreat. Letter from Dr. Goldberg enclosing certificate. Write request for furlough. Hand it to Lt. MacDougall. Too busy to confer with me about it which I have asked him to do. Promises to take care of it tomorrow. Retreat. Write to Leah and Mama. Supper. Roast beef, turnips, bread pudding, cocoa. Nap for a minute. Write. Sleep till 10. To K of C to telephone Leah. Business is sold. Pleased that Leah is relieved of responsibility. Back to quarters. Write till 11 in Mess Hall. To bed. Sleep well. Nothing has been said about passes for Passover, I think because Division will leave soon. Everything indicates it. I am afraid it will not be possible for me to get furlough. Believe Lt. MacDougall is putting me off to gain time. Have seen some truckloads of equipment apparently going to freight station. Boys thinking of taking AWOL if passes are not forthcoming. I advise them not to.

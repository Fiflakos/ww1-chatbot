Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 20 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. Jun. 20, 1918 Weather: Warm, Showers Health: Good Hike 12 kilometres to .......... Up at 8:00. No formalities to be observed. Breakfast ready a good while. Were it not for a rattling mess kit, many of us would have slept much longer. There are no details wanted, therefore I can go about my morning toilet feeling easy that my plans will not be disturbed and I need not hurry. Breakfast, bread, bacon, butter (real Am. stuff), coffee. Enough of everything to satisfy the most ravenous appetite. I wash and shave, then go towards Main Street. At every turn I make, one of the boys asks me to lend money. My accounts this month are larger than ever, due to our billets being in two big towns this week. Buy fruit and a newspaper. Caught in a shower, while I am close to shelter, giving me an opportunity to read. When it is again clear, I walk cautiously up and down outside of jewelers casting side glances at windows, trying to see a card displaying wedding rings. I cannot see any, but realizing the job must be done sooner or later, I screw up my courage and walk in, boldly. Ask for what I want in English, explaining with difficulty that I am a man who wants to buy a certain kind of ring, usually worn by a woman. Madame expresses surprise, blushingly, and pulls a card from a case, which was directly before my eyes. I feel ashamed of myself. Put nervousness down as cause for my lack of observation. All the rings I can see are of some yellow metal, not gold. No explanations are necessary and as I cannot understand anyhow, I make a quick decision to take one, if the price is fair. 6 Frs. is asked. I try on rings until I find one that fits me and prepare for a quick exit. I am afraid of consequences of being seen by any of our men. But once outside, I grew braver and do not hide my fingers. I want to see other end of town before I go back. Meet Ellsworth, a married man whom I can confide in, if necessary, for I have a wild idea I ought to tell what I have done. He wants a pipe but has not the price. I go with him and lend him enough to make his purchase. Go home intending to read newspaper and nap before Mess. Caught in middle of road in a heavy shower. Drenched by time I get to shelter, which begins to leak. Driven away, I go on and I do not stop until I reach quarters. Water runs off my slicker into my leggings and socks. My knees are wet. Thus I lie down to read, holding my ringed finger so that it is plainly visible to everybody. No one sees or notices it. My fears vanish and I feel quite at home in my new possession. Read until mess. Boiled beef, potatoes, bread, coffee. Display ring prominently while I peel potatoes. No notice paid to me. I decide that I am proof against detection. Lie down to sleep again for a few minutes. Out to try to purchase something of lace for Leah and baby. Monsieur Paul is in the store. He takes up too much of Madame's time, so I go away. Back to bed, sleep with a blanket ever my head to guard against being disturbed by flies, till 4:OO. Then write until supper. Boiled beef, potato, bread, coffee. Again fill canteen, roll pack, police around my bunk, wait for command to assemble. Formation at 7:00 to take check. Dismissed for an hour or so. Make a thorough tour of University grounds. See nothing of historical interest, excepting inscriptions dedicated to warriors and Jeanne de Arc. Munch nuts. In a room in our own building I find a room with many excellent cartoons and pictures. Wait upstairs, joining in singing and whistling. Assembled at 8:30. Whole battalion off in record time. Our Captain, acting Major. Wearing helmets and slickers. McKeon already drunk, falls out of rank for another drink and does not come back. Seen to go by Sgt., who does not interfere. It is murky and cloudy. Two hot to wear helmet. I disregard orders and take it off. Cheered going through town. Blessed by an old woman on outskirts, as we pass into main road. Another battalion comes in to take up quarters just vacated by us. A battalion of Iowans pulls in. Slurring remarks cast upon us by them engender bad feeling and give rise to use of much bad language. We promise to show them up. Rest after 1 hour. Capt. is in a hurry. We are up again in 10 minutes. Second hike through .........., and mostly uphill, skirting feet of mountain and into pine and birch forests, where it is almost as dark as on Monday night's march. This time only a seven minute rest. Along a road screened to left, with camouflage and barbed wire behind, which is artillery. No village in sight. I assume we will spend the night in trenches. A five minute rest. Smell horse. Into a wood dotted with lights. Met by billeting officers. We think these are our quarters. No rest yet for our weary bones. Hear a bell, which may be a gas alarm. It is a church bell. We are in town. A square, then a narrow lane to barracks at end of village. Our scouts and our signalmen are there. Charlie Pugh is there. He has not been gassed. Black is there. He is not killed. Mud is three inches deep for flooring. Bunks in squares containing 4 each. All those with hay bedding already taken by the time I get in. Smells like the devil from the damp. Do not relish prospects of sleeping on heavy wire, which cuts into body. It begins to rain so I cannot go out to find hay. Unroll pack and manage to get a handful of damp grass and put it across two upper bunks and team up with McGuire, who has just come in after falling out an march. Become sick, take two tent halves for bedding and two blankets for cover. Lie down to wait for hot coffee. None comes. Kitchen has been lost. Try chocolate. I am cold and disgusted with everything. I am trying to sleep and men who were at the front are telling lies about their experiences. Two distinct groups contradicting each other. If these are American barracks, give me English billets or tents. A disgrace to our wealthy nation. It rains all night. Lulled to sleep about 3:30 by cannonading, a forgotten sensation. Subdued but not far distant from what men who have been to front tell us.

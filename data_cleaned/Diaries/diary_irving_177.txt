Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 11 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Aug. 11, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Good A happy day: The Captain tells me he has recommended me to be one of the men who goes back to the States to instruct in Army Camp on infantry work. Up at 7:00. The first thing to think about is breakfast. Our own mess is not promised for 11 o'clock, because Doolan the Cook is too tired to get up. Lt. Hepburn goes below calling for him and looking for him, but he cannot be found until some of our men, who know where he has bunked, call him. I find we are not in as dense a forest as I at first thought. We look about for something to eat. Many bugles blowing mess call. Gillece tries to get mess at E Co. taking down two mess kits. He brings back coffee but no hash which is part of their mess. They are not in a generous mood this morning. Lts. also carefully watching the lines. Streetor goes down to E Co.'s line and gets none. I go down and manage to get coffee, but no more. Nothing to do but wait until our mess is ready. I wash and get water. Some men have been roaming about the woods and have picked up little things left behind by the Germans, such as newspapers, tin helmets, cigarette boxes. And then, in the wild scramble for water, which is hard to get, asking the Frenchmen who live in German built barracks a little above us, they get bottles of German mineral water of which 10 or 11 big cases have been left behind in their retreat. Our KPs must go a mile for it to the railroad station. A French water cart is filled up but they refuse to let us take any of it. Then the officers become aware of the rush to the mineral water, which the French give away, and forbid us to drink it. The French are dining sumptuously. They have ham, boiled, French fried potatoes, cheese, wine and coffee. Besides they have a well stocked larder of bologna, fresh vegetables and tinned stuffs. Our breakfast is ready. We have bacon, prunes raw, hard tack and coffee. We try an innovation which proves a success, by frying the biscuits after soaking them. We get plenty. Explosions heard right of us in the open field, without any warning, whizz or the echo of a gun. It is a continued a mystery to us until we decide that our men are exploding duds of which there are thousands strewn about in the fields. Wandering through the ........ woods, other men discover dugouts and machine gun emplacements, rifles and gas masks. Some potato mashers about, and it is not long before men are reported to have hurt themselves picking up and meddling with things they know nothing about. The officers forbid wandering about or going to town without a pass. Even when going for water the men cannot leave the camp area without a pass. Full equipment must be worn, which as before is a source of discomfort and unruliness among the men. Lt. Bush of .. Co. gives his men a little lecture on the subject, telling them to submit with the best of grace, for only by obedience to the order can they bring about its recall. Aeroplanes are more numerous here than any place we have been in. They fly low enough for the pilot to be seen or so high that they are either invisible or can just barely be seen. All of them, whether Ally or Boche are shelled by anti-aircraft guns as soon as they are within range. The artillery is still peppering away with just the least bit less intensity than during the night, when it is reported, our boys advance eight kilos. Anxious to write but nowhere can I obtain privacy and quiet. Nothing better to do, fall asleep until I hear the rattle of mess kits, which means dinner is ready. Same old roast 275beef hash, that I am growing tired of, stewed prunes, hard tack and coffee, which has become a scarce thing lately. After attending to a few little duties around my bunk, I write, lying down in the sun on a blanket. It soon becomes very uncomfortable. Roasting hot and my body becomes stiff from the position I lie in. I must move. Almost as fast as I move the sun follows me. I cannot find shade and comfort near bunk. Constantly interrupted by the throb and boom of aeroplane motors. There is as much traffic in the air as there is on the roads. Force of will enables me to finish my task by supper time. We have more hash, biscuits and coffee. Inclined to take a walk into the hollow where are a lot of German works of interest. There are shelters for riflemen and machine gunners on the slope, so plentiful that it looks like a network of holes. A well was being sunk into the sandy ground, which was half completed when the Boche was forced to run. The sand taken out of the hole is as white as the sand of the beaches of which it reminds me. Little huts built of corrugated iron, built for two, are being occupied by our men. The large barracks, I notice, are of the ready built type, which come shipped complete, ready to set up. Unexploded shells and bombs plentiful among the trees and in the bushes. The Frenchman shows us two big shells and explains to us in where they are inferior to ours. Shell holes plentiful but little evidence of gas having been used. Occasionally the nasty smell of decomposing flesh. I have Gillece's pistol with me and therefore do not wish to stay out long for fear he may wish to use it, so I return and I am informed that the Captain wishes to see me. I cannot imagine what for. There is a smile upon Lt. Cook is face as I draw near and from that I take it I am in for a scolding about something, which is the only thing in connection with me he would find delight in. I salute the Captain, who draws me aside and tells me he has been asked to send in to headquarters the name of a man whom he thinks should go back to the States, and he has recommended me. I cannot believe my ears. I do not know what to say. I am all atremble. I thank him as best I can. Tell him that I have been very much interested in my work, but would like to go home to see baby and Leah. Go back to where my blankets lie and stare into space and dream of home. I tell nobody of what has happened. Soon the rumor spreads that men from each company are going home; then their names become known. The battalion orderlies, who brought in the orders and took back the names submitted, have spread the news. My name is in everybody's mouth. Some are jealous, others are glad that it is I whom the Captain wishes to send home. I am congratulated on all sides. Pestered to death with the well wishers, when I long to be left alone with Leah, Cecilie and Mama. Kelly and Fleischer, runners, tell me in confidence what I already know. Men want me to take their addresses so that I can visit their folks and take back things with me, for them. Schlesinger makes a very impassioned speech about how he goes into the battle ahead. He is sure of death and wants me to tell his elder brother all about it, have supper at his house and cheer up his mother. I refuse to listen to him. Tell him to follow my example whenever there is a mother's worries to worry about. Accept nobody's commissions or congratulations, for I still cannot believe that I may go home. I cannot believe that a 1st class private will be accorded the privilege and honor of going home to instruct men and why was my name selected. I never was a favorite with the Captain or Lt. C. I lie down, undress, get under the covers. It becomes more quiet. I can hear my name mentioned in the tents near me. Hell breaks loose soon after dark. The sky lit up by flames of white and red light, continuously. The guns go off at intervals of a 276tenth of a second, so with my thoughts it will be impossible to sleep the few hours that remain till 3:30, when we must be on the move again. Canteens ordered filled, which is an order that has an ominous import. It seems that we go into the lines. There is the added worry of being killed before the 19th, when the men to go back to the States get under way. The joyous news I have heard and the worry about our next move have the effect of keeping me awake all night. I pray fervently and long that the Lord let me go home to my loved ones, safe and soon. Try hard as I will, I cannot shut my eyes. My brain is too active. I am fully awake. I see and hear everything that goes on. Time goes slowly. The stars are out in full force and I see the wonders of the night. Stars fall to earth and stars rise slowly, vanish into the heavens. Our monitor gun not far from us is fired at regular intervals and the shock is so great that my body seems to rise from the ground with each explosion. I hear the cooks get up, hear them call the bugler later, and once I look behind me and think the forest is aflame from the cook's fire, which I am afraid will be seen and draw a bomb from the enemies' planes. Stars rise and stars fall. All omens are propitious and I am almost certain that I will go home. Mon. Aug. 12, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Hike 7 Kilos to east of ........ in the woods, and later back again with lift in a lorry Hop out of bed as soon as the bugle blows, lighthearted and happy. Though I have not slept a wink all night, I do not mind. I am feeling as fresh as a daisy. Mess call blows. I go towards the kitchen fire, which is my guide, stumbling over tree stumps and matted brush in the dark underfoot. The men of my company are silent. The men of other companies are glad that I go home and congratulate me heartily. In spite of my protests that I am not sure, they all take it for granted that I am the lucky man. Had I but known what lies in store for me! I protest, yes, but I am sure that I will go back on the 19th, for have I not prayed all night and have I not had a thousand omens before me that augured well. I build castles instead of inquiring of the Captain is it possible to send home a private. I am shown consideration by the cook who gives me plenty of bacon, prunes, hard tack and coffee and the men all make way for me and bowing, seeing me already a sergeant or more. Dress by the fire and make up my pack as soon as I get to my blanket. The day breaks. Soon a wonderful purple sunrise tints the sky. Is not such a sunrise a good omen and if all the boys smile when I think of home, does not that mean that I go home? My pack made up. Streetor gives me tobacco. Gillece pays a debt that he owes me. That annoys me. We form at 5 and march to the road. I can walk 20 miles to-day, with a pack on my back. Out on the road we wait for E and F Cos. to assemble and march behind us. In front is a plain, which under a veil of mist looks like a sea in the morning quiet. Piles of shells at regular intervals on the road, which the Boche left behind in his hurried flight. Shells packed in wicker cases, thousands of feet of narrow gauge railroad track, tools, etc. "Duds" all over the place. At 5:15 we are off. Pass a German ammunition dump, the largest ever seen. More than a million shells of all sizes and kinds are here. The system of camouflage employed something new. Readily see its effectiveness. Old abandoned guns, helmets, cartridges, articles of clothing, cookers, limbers. We march openly across the plain in full view of 277the enemy, if he is looking. Over the battlefield where are evidences of the struggle everywhere, the crops of wheat ruined, the graves of Germans in the fields and by the road, the ground pitted with shell holes. Mounds of earth from which comes a terrible stench. Rotting remains of horses and humans underneath, or perhaps in the grain where they fell unnoticed. The crows which rise from the fields at our approach in such great numbers, probably disclose where men and horses rot in the hot sun. After passing a piece of road which smells, the fresh air seems good and it is a relief to breathe again. One cannot hold one's breath too long. Simpson, who marches beside me, can talk of nothing but my good fortune, till I doubt if it is well to be so sure of the visit I may pay Leah, Cecilie and Mama. I ask him to change the subject of conversation. We come to a bar across the road. The Lieutenant runs ahead to reconnoiter. There is a bridge, which has been blown up and destroyed. We think it spans a river flowing through a deep cut. The Major commands "Forward" and I see myself wading through water. I pity the Major's well-polished boots and natty uniform. For myself, I don't care. Nothing matters now. We march up to the bank. It is a railroad cut 40 ft. deep with a 60 degree angle. A precarious descent which the Major makes over the broken rock of the fallen span. I follow his path instead of going down the grassy slope where there is no footpath. Danger of exploding bombs among the rocks, German bombs which lie strewn around promiscuously in large numbers. Those who follow are ordered not to cross over the rocks. The Major stands on the bank on the other side directing the Capt. as to how to bring over his men, while I take the tiring, hot, steep climb up with a heavy pack on my back. It will take more than a half hour to bring all the men across, which we who were lucky to lead the column will enjoy by resting. On the other side an ammunition dump blown up, shells spread all over the terrain. Rest for a long time at the crossroads while we watch aeroplane battles, see them manoeuver as they are shelled from the ground; admire the courage of the aviators. Our big guns being drawn on rubber-tired trucks to take up new positions further ahead to keep up with the advancing infantry. We are off again, passing by anti-aircraft guns mounted behind camouflaged shelters on the plains, and heavy artillery quite close to us, yet which we cannot locate accurately. The crash as they go off, sometimes more than one at a time, hurts my eardrums so that I cannot hear. The concussion shakes us up pretty well. Through ........ going east into the woods. We halt and rest in a sheltered spot for an hour, while a camp site is being looked up by the officers. Two Germans lie buried near us and it smells when the wind blows in our direction. Try to sleep but I cannot. There is too much noise from the artillery, which is below us now, and besides I am on my way home. A site found, we march to it, stack arms and remove equipment, lie around in horse dung and hay wondering about dinner. Some hard tack about the men, which is divided up. Lt. orders two men back to where three companies are, without packs, so that they may lead them in, in the afternoon. Then a corporal and two privates rise to go back to Regimental Hdqrs. to wait till the 1st and 3rd battalions come up in from 1 to 5 days. Sgt. sends me on the party as I will soon leave them. Take my pack and go back with Doherty and McCleary. Meet Moss, company clerk. He is not so cordial as yesterday. Meet Cpl. Rist, who congratulates me and shakes my hand. On the road to wait for 3 men, whom Moss is sending back. They do not appear, so we go off without them in a fierce hot blistering sun. No lorry to give us a lift. A dead horse in a ditch by the roadside to offend us. Get a lift in an ambulance to near 278the YMCA warehouse. They do not sell at retail, but we convince the men that we are hungry, so we get a box of crackers each. Walk for a while in the road, dusty and red hot. A lorry gives us a lift. I lose my helmet and almost my life getting on. To the devil with the helmet. I will get another, somewhere, so I do not bother getting off to recover it. I value the ride more. Two men from the outfit we relieve are in the car. They tell of their hardships. 30 days in the line, nothing to eat, no water, not properly clothed. Tell how they drove the huns and how it cost them about 60% of the men. They steal a tin of bully beef from the chauffeur's iron ration, so hungry are they. Get off in ........ and find Headquarters after a little difficulty. Scout about for something to eat and get bully beef hash, bread and coffee with Hdqrs. Company. The colonel sends Corp. Doherty back again with a message to Major Budd in a side car, fortunately for Doc. We hang around till supper. Macaroni, some hash, bread, coffee. Doherty comes back. I am writing. Bougartz comes with a message to the Colonel. It is that the Captain wants to replace Corp. Rist's name with Sgt. Burley's name as the man who goes home. This means that Rist, the man who shook hands with me, honestly glad that I go home, has been substituted for me and I can see why. My Captain again at fault and he cannot pay the debt he owes me. He did not know enough to make me a non-com for the occasion. I am dumb and dejected, sad and mad. Rist's name has already been submitted and the Colonel will not substitute another. I am glad for Rist's sake. I am not jealous. It is my Captain's fault and my own for not questioning the point in doubt - my rank. Not yet will I see Leah and Cecilie and Mama. I will wait and trust in God. He knows. It is His will. I write until dark. Pitch a tent with Doherty in the dark. We have no pins, no poles. A comical situation, an awful job. One minute we laugh, the next we swear. Bayonets, bolos, trench twines, wire, pins made out of twigs and an old badger shoe (McCleary's) play a part. Go to bed sweating from the exertion. I say my prayers. "His will Be Done." A wild night on the battlefield. I cannot sleep. I curse every man who fires a gun. Even myself, if I ever do. Restless and awake all night. The guns are thunder, the flares are lightning, the rain is shrapnel. Why do men do it? Why do they kill? Why do they destroy? I have no courage to-night. No will to live. Then think of Leah and Cecilie. I must not despair. 2 of our OB's brought down in flames.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 23 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. Jun. 23, 1918 Weather: Warm, Showers Health: Good Up at 7:00, instead of 6:30 as scheduled. Top Sgt. has overslept. He is not very insistent this morning that absentees be reported for this reason. No Reveille formation to catch up with schedule. Best breakfast in France. Rice, prunes and stewed apples, bread, Karo, coffee. Police. Our company goes on guard again. I expect to be called but am not. Newspaper man comes to put us in good humour. Raining intermittently. Sgt. looking for a detail. I must air my blankets at that time. Wash and shave at the town pump. Get stationary from YMCA by sending Kronenberg to get it. Lie down on hillside where my blankets are spread out and begin writing a letter to Mama. Kronenberg comes to join me. Now Sgt. Nichols is looking for a detail. It begins to rain. Two excuses to go to YMCA to write are better than one. Gather up my blankets and put them on bunk, going in back entrance to barrack. Out back way and avoid Sgt. Get to YMCA. Upstairs, where are two writing rooms with a half dozen board tables and benches. A forgotten feeling of comfort to sit at a table while writing. Downstairs a man is playing the piano. Syncopated and classic. He does very well at both. It must be a great comfort for such a man to be where he can find a piano when he is at leisure. Someone joins him singing a song accompanied by piano. From somewhere across the street, I hear a phonograph. I was deeply immersed in my writing. Startled by resemblance to Sunday at home. Pause to listen. It is just as when I was at home, lying in bed, thinking of my afternoon visit to Leah, my sisters play the piano, while a wheezy phonograph is grinding out ragtime from somewhere in the courtyard. In those days I was seriously annoyed at the intrusion on my thoughts. Strangely this morning I am not. I value music too much to complain. Go on writing, telling Mother about it, and thinking how pleased Leah will be when she hears of incident. I mean to tell her about it too. I must coach Kronenberg in spelling. Now a religious service is being held downstairs. Hymns are sung. A soloist, A sermon, A prayer. Impressive in the extreme. Write a letter to Sam Friedman, before I go to quarters. Mess. Boiled beef, potatoes, bread, coffee. Excellent. Clean gun. Begin a letter to Willets. Called out at 1:15 for company formation to go to rifle range again. Today entire company will shoot with exception of riflemen learning Souchard. Range detail is picked from among men who shot twice yesterday. Using same targets as yesterday. All paste and markers. Targets cannot be distinguished. Lt. takes no interest in scores. Each man looks at his own target. I shoot ten shots, making a fine group. Lie down to take a nap, while waiting for company to finish work. A heavy hail storm comes up. It rattles on helmets and covers the ground with a blanket of white. A stiff wind bends young pines and birch in the forest like reeds. It thunders too. Twice a rain shower interrupts. Expert shots in company put at rapid firing, Non-coms in particular. Then scouts are pitted against non-coms. We show them up. I get off nine shots in the allotted minute and as nearly as I can judge there are four bullseyes on my card and a good group of three just below. This fusillade ends the day's work. Write again. Supper. Canned roast beef, potato, bread, rice, coffee. Wonder is expressed at how good a complaint does. Finish letter to Willets. Not neglecting Leah, I write 8 pages to her. Mail distributed to-day. For first time since mail has been arriving, I do not receive any. By candlelight lie down in Rubin's bunk next to mine to write. It is softer bedded than mine, more roomy. Stay there until dispossessed by three occupants who wish to sleep. Continue writing in my bunk until Sgt. orders all lights out and noise stopped at 10 o'clock. Lenehan who is being punished for his recent drunk by being given nasty detail work, was put to work picking up orange peels and nut shells in streets of town. When he goes to bed he tells of his discomfort while at his task. Frenchmen laugh at him, our men jibe. He tells how he was given a bag big enough to hold all the orange peels in France. Objects that the men who ate the fruit threw skins where they are hard to get at, in mud holes, ditches, etc., instead of in middle of street. He thinks that orange skins are used by the British for making marmalade. I laugh more than I have in months. Laughter is irresistible, listening to Lenehan tell his troubles in a dry plaintive voice, making everyone laugh, yet he lies in bed without a smile disturbing his features. He is paying dearly for his drunk. But "every dog has his day" he says. While here everyone is carefree and comfortable, mirth reigning until late in the night, not far away men are dying and being wounded to-night. Observation balloons were up early in the morning. All day the air was alive with the drone of aeroplane motors. The sound of shells bursting high in air came every minute. At sundown activity on a large scale was commenced. Barrages were laid down after that until long after we went to sleep. Apparently Fritz's welcome to our men. We wonder what the casualty list will be and whether our Battalion is engaged in the struggle to-night. Some of our men expect to be awakened during the night to go up as reinforcements. All have our respirators nearby and remove as little clothing as possible. Anxiously await reports. Ginsburg returns from the hospital cured. Tells us of other men. He has travelled over France, going through Paris, Rouen, and has had a bully time. He loves nurses, treatment he received, and gets a hearty welcome from us. Glad he is back with us.

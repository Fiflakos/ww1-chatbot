Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 25 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Thu. Jul. 25, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Go to ......... Up at 6:30. Syrop wakes me as he had promised. Upon entering, tell the Mess Sgt. I am going away and want to eat early. He .............. me with bacon, syrup, bread, coffee. Hurry to wash and shave. While doing these things, I get orders from the boys for souvenirs, handkerchiefs. Get French money from Mitchell in exchange for last 10 dollar bill of our money remaining. Borrow 35 Frs. from Himpler, fill my canteen with drinking water. Take a pistol, helmet, gas mask and ..... and at 7:30 I am on my way. Three aeroplanes up as usual. Take the new road downhill all the way, to ........ . On the road I am surprised to find Hackett and a squad of men combing it. They are ambitious looking boys. Glad to see me. I tell them what I have been doing in the few minutes I spend with them. Go on till almost in ........ when I see Del 100 yards down the road. He steps out and begins to smile and welcome me before I am well in sight. He also has a squad of men working on the roads. He is most pleased to see me and I tell him how good it is to see him. Tells me news of company while I rest. He is angry at the army for having sentenced me to two weeks in the 239lines and also at Captain McMurtry for not having permitted him to go back to the States. He was a more logical candidate than Guttenberger. In the company orderly room, after I got news of Capt. Condon, from Cluster. Say Hello to Capt. I expected him to show more interest in me than he does. Corp. Haight just as phlegmatic as ever. He goes to OT 6. More his understudy, assuming the same air of unconcern. Ask for my pay, which has been turned back to Div. Personnel Bureau. Requisition for shoes and underwear, which I am told is all I can get. Hear that Sgt. Greenstein has found my old letters at Indian Village. I look for Astrove to get corroboration of the death of Harry Schneider. He has learned soon after the fatal raid of his death. Sgt. Lennon knows him too. Off to ........ to look up Sgt. Greenstein. I find him. He tells me that Rubin or somebody picked up some of my letters, last time he was there. I find Rubin. He knows nothing about them. I ask the others if they have seen my letters. I look for them myself but find nothing. Imagine I have not very much time and wish to push on, asking boys to look for my letters and hold them for me if they find any. Rubin gives me 20 Frs. for the money he owes me. It is welcome. Meet Greenstein, Goldberg, Eddington, at the fork of the road. They are waiting for a lorry to take them to ........ . They have rations for the day with them and invite me to have dinner with them in ........, and share what they have. Tell me how everybody resents my unjust sentence. We wait a long time till a lorry comes. A most welcome lift up the steep hill. Much jesting. In ........ we go to a house where Greenstein has bunked and woman will make our dinner for us. On the road I see the 2nd Battalion scouts. Red Shannon hails me to tell me that Archer has some of my lost letters. I do not know how he knew I had lost them and doubt if he has them. One of the boys takes me to him and sure enough gives me a bundle of letters, which I am most happy to see again. Accompanying them is a cute note from Archer. I thank them all and go up to the house. The woman makes wonderful embroidered laces by hand. I make a bargain with her for five collarettes at 75 Frs. Pleased with my purchase. Stay for dinner. Steak, chips, salad, beans, bread, beer, coffee and service. A young mother and an old spinster our hosts. Smoke and read the paper until Baby is brought in. I think of my Cecilie, whom I have not seen. This is a pretty baby. I want to kiss her, but I cannot. I want to wait till I get home before I kiss babies. I play with her but even that is too much a reminder of home, so I run away. I go outside. At 1 o'clock I leave for ........ . A good road, but dusty. MP asks for pass. Tell him I have one. Pass him. A wonderful scene before me. Golden grain in sheaves in field and farmers cutting it. I am tired and hot but go on without resting. Strange men in town. I help two women lift a bag of oats on truck. Ask who is in town. No definite answer. Buy a tomato. Shop for handkerchiefs. Buy some good ones. Then to cut glass shop. Much difficulty in making a selection. Finally decide on two small vases for buffet. Perfect cut glass. They come to 60 Frs. I look to see how much money I have. Only 50 Frs. I have to look for something else or go away without anything. Nothing else takes my fancy. Induce proprietor, who talks English well, to let me have the selection I made, promising to send the difference to him. Leaves me without money for postage. Will take packages back to Griffiths to OK. He cuts a monogram in both of the vases. Packs them in a box filled with straw. I insert a card for Leah. Go back to the boys at once. The most wonderful scene I have ever looked upon. Hills, mountains, fields and the village nestling in the valley. A hot walk of 3/4 hour. Meet Archer and thank him for his kindness in salvaging my letters. The boys are waiting for 240me. I wash. Supper ready in ten minutes. Steak, chips, salad, omelette, beer, coffee. Baby looks very pretty. I play with her. Old man and the boy comes home. Hard workers. See children with tin cans tied to their feet. 6:30. I start back to ........ . Greenstein forgets things and must go back. We wait in the road for him. A lorry comes down. He is in it. We get on and go to our destination. They must get out at ........ . I go on to ........ . All the boys from the company in the square. They come to attend a concert to celebrate the opening of a Salvation Army Canteen. In the orderly room, Pimpl calls me aside to tell me he has something for me. More of my old letters. My cup of joy is complete. He wants the reward I promised Mullin. Three aeroplanes up. See Haight about mailing my package. As usual I get no satisfaction from him. Hang around for a while, trying to get some information about our next move. Get none. Hear that Reilly is in the hospital. On way again to my quarters by foot, up the steep hills. A terribly warm walk My wind surprisingly poor. Must stop to pant and wipe sweat frequently. Road seems four times longer than it really is. Dark when I get back to barracks. Boys had given up hope of seeing me. I rest and cool off, then give them the handkerchiefs I have purchased for them. My shopping tour a success. Everybody pleased, except those whom I forgot about. McLeary's check I have forgotten to cash. Chocolate could not be purchased. Put away my packages until to-morrow, intending to write. Cannot get hold of ink. I am tired, so make no serious effort to do so. Hear that Lt. Griffiths goes home to the States. Wade is summoned before the Major and told to roll pack. He is drunk when he goes up. Howe helps him. In ten minutes order changed. He is to wait till to-morrow and turn in all his stuff. We think he will be punished. Mystery surrounds the affair. Go to bed at 10. In spite of itch and hard bed, I find it hard to stay awake long enough to say my prayers. Wade and Howe are having a contest as usual for the honor of telling the best smutty story. Sleep well. I have spent all my money and am in debt about 50 Frs. Boys agree I purchased well, when I show them the pretty laces. They all would like to own some. See old men threshing grain. Entire town is busy with the harvest. Renny is still with 2nd Battalion scouts. Nothing has been done to punish him.

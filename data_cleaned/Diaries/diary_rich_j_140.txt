Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 27th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 27th. Monday.I went across to Ribemont and saw Lieut. Biddieof Manly and Sydney, a Rugby Unionist.He was like most of the men just now with hisview that there was no end to the war in sight at all.He even went as far as to say that we could never makeGermany give way to defeat, they are too solid and clever.He was inclined to the opinion that the French would firstgive way and be the forerunners to peace.There is a good deal of reason in his idea frommy own way of looking the matter up.If Roumania had only been able to hold out allmight have been different. Now, with so much success allaround I fear the Central Powers have a long lead and canhold all they have with very few men by building undergroundfortresses and using a few sniper and a large periscope whichwe must expose masses of men to drive them out. Those submarines are playing the devil with ourships while the casualty lists and Zepplin raids are breakingthe hearts of our people.The German people are no doubt kept ignorant ofthe facts that are likely to dishearten the mass and so theyare confident of victory and can show very good argument toback their confidence.I don't know, I'm sure. I cannot conceive thatthe Allies will be absolutely bested, but on the other handI can see no chance of ever besting Germany, alas! Thissumming up does not alarm me one bit, because I can't seethat a nation should have to win wars to live and to prosper.

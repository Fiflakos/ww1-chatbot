I would have slept for hours were it not for the other boys, anxious to get their breakfast. They awake me. Dress hurriedly. Breakfast not to my liking. Greasy bacon again. I have had so much of that stuff. Too much. That is why my stomach is out of order. Make a few pieces of toast for myself and with a cup of coffee, I have a satisfactory breakfast. Look for pills which I have put in a small envelope in wash stand. It has disappeared. Strikes me as funny that any person should have made away with pills. Wash and shave. I have a plea to make before Capt. F., so I want to look as neat as possible when I go. I take with me my ammunition belt and at my side is empty holster. No one will look close enough to notice the deception, and to the passerby it will look as if I am armed. On the way I meet a member of the prison squad who says he has been reassigned to his company. An observation balloon is up, so I cannot go to Company Hdqrs. by the direct route. Must make a detour. Capt. or top Sgt. not about to speak to me or listen to my troubles. They are escorting the Colonel through the lines. Men assure me they will be back in an hour or so. I know it takes longer than that to make an observation tour with the Colonel and I intend to go back to quarters shortly to write. Sit on a mattress outside the dugout, reading part of letter to Leah, which I wrote yesterday. An even dozen aeroplanes make their appearance, high up in the clouds, coming from the south, where there are so many it is hard to tell by the sound of their motors, who they are, but judging from the white smoke of the shells, which, an instant after, burst all around them, they were German planes. In five minutes that entire patch of sky was dotted with puffs of white smoke, a hundred of them at least, and while I read, I distinctly hear the whizz of two shell nose caps, which come from up above and land not very far away from me. After I finish reading, I stay a little while to swear at myself for having lost my cap, which I am sure I took with me. Look around for it and inquire. Then it dawns upon me that when I took my belt off in my room, it must have fallen out. Return without leaving any word behind, I wonder if some new punishment will be visited on me and a second later forget about it. Bid the Frenchman good morning and make my way back to quarters, very leisurely. It must be seen that I am sick. A squadrille of French planes up over us in pursuit of the Boche. Too far behind. They have long ago gone out of sight and hearing. It proves a very active morning. Our friends, the Frenchmen, have their artillery working in good form today and are letting Fritz know about it. The 75s are kept working all day. No stops for lunch or anything like that. They have work to do demolishing some of Fritz recent works within his lines, which our observers have spotted. His observation post and a few machine gun emplacements are targets we play upon, I believe. Later in the day success is reported. Back in quarters, lie on my stomach on bunk, writing until noon time. I find another few sheets of paper, with which I must be satisfied, though of smaller size, and I continue writing letter to Leah. Besides the story of the Englishman, I tell her about Ruben, when he awakened us by "mistake". It takes 22 pages to talk to her. Read and seal in an envelope, then comes the question of how and where to mail it. Read for a time. Take a nap for a half hour or so. Think it is a good time to write a letter to Morris Berger. I make a beginning on it at any rate, keeping me occupied until supper time. I am not hungry, but it is best to eat something. Make a few 215slices of toast and have my usual cup of coffee. A few stolen figs. Bit of steak, which I have had with my dinner, is still in my stomach and causing me considerable distress. By that I am able to tell what part of my diet is harmful. Must be fried foods, for yesterday I had a piece of roast meat, without any bad after effects. I will avoid anything with grease in its composition. I finish Morris's letter. I am more or less aware that it is a bilious composition. I do not seal it therefore. To keep occupied, read a newspaper and try a book. My eyes hurt. I lie down but not to sleep. Quickly I am rested and interested in pinochle game, which has been going on all afternoon. A slow game, for small stakes, being played by men, not because of the money which is won or lost, but for the interest to be found in it. I tire of watching them. So I begin writing a letter to Annette which is interrupted by the lights going out. The card game has been finished at 10. My letter not important enough to warrant burning candle which will keep the men awake. They are going out to work on sunburst patrol tonight. Some of them are, and an hour's sleep will come in handy. Originally early in the day a patrol of large proportions was planned for. It would have taken nearly every man in the detachment to satisfy the Lt. Batt. Hdqrs. interferes and changes plans. Dizzy army, the boys say. Only this crowd does that! They do not know that our Batt. Hdqrs. interferes with our scouting plans every day. Our Lt. spent more time consulting with the Major at Batt. Hdqrs. than he did with us. There is no need to feel disappointed. Sleep is better than scouting. Guard reports a very dark night and owing to prolonged quiet and conditions, it is possible an attack will be made tonight. Guard is doubled on post below. While I am awake, I can hear the guard halting everybody who passes and the steady firing of a 75 in back of us. I still sleep alone, taking up space two should occupy, while some men sleep on the floor. During the night I am awakened frequently, when the reliefs are made and when an extra heavy explosion disturbs me. I have a dream. Mr. Willetts has bought a half interest in my business while I have been in Europe and has incorporated it. Leah has been taken into partnership and will travel through Pennsylvania selling stock for the concern, which seems to me to be a get rich quick scheme. Other complications, which make me laugh to myself. Someone remarks that this is no war, because twenty miles from No Man's Land men are playing pinochle and singing "Ally Up". It may just as well be accomplished in No Man's land, weather permitting.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 28 June 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Jun. 28, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Diarrhea, Cramps I wake up men and go to sleep. Asked if I want breakfast. I have no desire to eat. Stomach overloaded. Cramps. Bowels are loose. A cup of coffee will do me. I go to sleep again. Do not awaken till 10. Nobody about. Beside my blanket is a cup of coffee and two slices of bread and butter. Coffee is cold, so I build a small fire of twigs and paper to heat it. Succeed only in getting it lukewarm. Relish a meal. Seized with cramps again. Back and try to write. I begin a letter to Leah, writing 2 1/2 pages. My eyes are tired and I fall asleep again. Remember mess time. Wake up to find all the men back and asleep. No one has moved to camp in back woods this morning. Tell men it is mess time and ask them to kindly bring me some coffee and bread. Rubin volunteers to do so. I thank him. One reason I do not go up to where mess is served is that our squad members are taking their turn at returning dixies to kitchen, a trip of almost a mile, in which a steep hill is encountered. I do not feel equal to the task, and I am afraid I will be asked to go. Write again until Rubin brings me a cup of coffee and Lukas has 11 letters from home for me, 1 from Willie, 1 from Morris, who is in the country, taking advantage of a honeymoon, 2 from Lottie and seven from Leah, the first dating from May 30th, Decoration Day. Her thoughts on that day were of a year ago, similar to those I wrote about in my Decoration Day letter to her. I am very happy and relieved to receive letters from home and as usual do not open and read them until everything else is done. I heat my coffee, after spending half an hour or so trying to get a fire started, without success. Eat bread and butter, while I read Leah's letter. She has received mail from me in France, but I do not know which. Reference may have been made to three in the 15 or more other letters which have not arrived. Leah is quite evidently worried, because she has had so few letters from me. She is trying her very best to keep from crying. A package of goodies is on the way to me, being brought in a trunk by a friend of Miss Hogues, who is in France to do canteen work. All news, otherwise, is cheerful. Baby and Leah are well, thank God. I write a bit more until word is sent down from Hdqrs. that we must go up to sign payroll, something I thought wouldn't be done this month. I am not at all anxious to go up, having no need for money, and would rather continue writing to Leah. Rubin is going up and urges me to accompany him; besides it is an order and since it is known that I am in camp, I will have to obey. I go out for first time to-day. It is very hot in the sun. A three quarter of a mile walk. Payroll is signed under a camouflaged hill, where not long ago was a big gun. Back by way of ......... . Pick and eat a few cherries, which are so tempting that I cannot resist, though I should. Into town from other end, where our company has never been. Go to YMCA to buy some crackers, which I eat on the way back to camp. Portion of town I have just passed through recently shelled. Take a short cut into the fields, bearing down upon our camp in the right direction at the beginning, but in crossing over barbed wire entanglements, I lose my way. Go much behind the pines in which we live. Meet Del Duca and Rubin coming back. I have heard some one practicing shooting with a rifle. Sound seems to be coming toward me, but I continue walking. When we are back in our grove, Del Duca begins cleaning his rifle, then taking out his pistol, finds it has been hit just outside ejector slot by a bullet, which went through his holster. He finds splinters of bullet in bottom of case. A marvelously narrow escape for him. It seems in the ranks of C Company, there is one every day. I lie on my stomach on a blanket, writing, feeling very uncomfortable, until I fall asleep. I am asked do I want anything for supper. Not a thing. I thank Rubin for being so kind. I awake at 8 o'clock, cranky and annoyed to find nothing for me to eat. I have an appetite and would especially like something to drink. Not a drop of water in any of the canteens. Ask permission to go to YMCA, and incidentally to fill water bottles. Permitted to go provided I bring back water. I take three bottles and go down the road in the dark. Our artillery near at hand is beginning a little shelling of Fritz. YMCA still open to my surprise. It is electric lighted. So are main buildings and very little precaution is taken to screen lights. I get crackers for my supper and fill water bottles, going back quietly along the road in the dark until I come upon the squad standing to, in the trench post assigned to us. Del Duca is doing the talking as usual. I leave a bottle of water for them, then go down for my gun and belt. I do not feel very much like standing guard, yet it is best not to complain. I come up and listen half asleep, to Del Duca. At 10:15, I go down to sleep. Guns near us are spitting fire, but at the front things are quiet. Corporal has been told, a barrage is expected and an attempt will be made to break through, to be especially watchful for gas. I am on guard with Rubin, from 1:10 to 3:30. I fall asleep and slumber soundly until McGuire awakens us to go on post. Up quickly; in five minutes I am on duty. Nothing has happened and it is very quiet now. Occasionally machine gun fire. I am again seized with cramps. I am very uncommunicative. Rubin makes efforts to draw me out, but does not succeed. His stories of business successes and reverses do not interest me. Time is dragging. Toward 3:15, as dawn is breaking to replace a dark, cloudy night, a German aeroplane is heard. It is coming in our direction. My steel helmet is on and gas mask alert. I wonder why nothing is being done to scare him away or no effort being made to shell him. Presently, hum of motor from our own plane heard giving chase. Reason enough why no shells are sent skyward. A running game of hide and seek is played until they are out of earshot. I go down to wake up Lukas and Gillece, our relief. I go to bed and sleep very well. It is warm. Annoyed with myself for not having written to Leah. I had ample opportunity to do so. Find a 191beautiful bird nest and with it prove correctness of my contentious discussion with Rubin about family responsibility.

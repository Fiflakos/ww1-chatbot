Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 13 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Jul. 13, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. It has rained hard during the night. Men are just returning from a special patrol. It has the usual disastrous results. The party had been challenged from an outpost in which were men who were probably not aware that the party might be expected to return at that point. There was a slight misunderstanding. The patrol quickened its movement, a Frenchman in the party dropped a bomb which he had ready decapped for instant use. He was killed, one man mortally wounded, dying during the day, and 4 of Co. K boys are injured more or less severely. I am feeling considerably better as far as my stomach is concerned. I have rice and bacon, bread and coffee for breakfast without any after distress. Do not think it necessary to report to the work squad since I have officially reported sick. But I need a bandage for binding my foot which still shows a rash. Go to the infirmary for some, coming back to quarters to find everybody asleep. Absolute and ideal quiet reigns, making a fine opportunity to write. I take advantage of it at once. Two big planes are over the lines, cutting capers for Fritz. They draw fire every time they circle over his 218territory and as long as they remain within range. They are evidently taking photographs and scouting. Flying low enough to be seen and heard from the window where I sit. Admire their daring. Machine guns also open up on them. One of the new boys comes in to look at them from the window through glasses. He reports their movements to me, while I write. Some shells from 75s are sent under their direction. Write until noon time. Men on awakening, again begin to talk about the accident which occurred during the night. One of them has helped bring them in and tells how fearful a sight the wounded men are. Dinner. Beef stew with green peas, bread, coffee. Feel well. Take a nap of a half hour. Sgt. Stewart comes in to inquire if I know the location of a post, outside of which is a timed iron pig or minniewafer, which has not been exploded. Engineers are here for the purpose of detonating it. They are taken out by Wager and everybody is warned to keep under cover and told when they might expect to hear the explosion. I have hit upon the idea of writing a story, based upon yesterday's experiences, to Leah, but so as not to frighten her I will not tell her when it happened. I look for a place outside in the sun to sit while I write. It is windy wherever I locate. While perched for a few minutes on a wall next to our chateau, a loud explosion coming from a very nearby point, almost jolts me from my position. I get down and cross the street to tell the men it is advisable to seek shelter in the dugout. I think some very heavy shelling is about to begin, very close at hand. They remind me of the missing wafer the engineers had been sent out to explode, which I had completely forgotten about, so I return to my perch until I find it inconvenient to write in the wind. Go upstairs. After a rather slow beginning, I gather momentum and by supper time I have written considerably. Shelling from our guns intermittently. A Boche plane is brought down. It is seen to tumble towards earth by the men in the kitchen. I envy them. The fall of an aeroplane is the only sight I an anxious to witness. From accounts it is brought down by machine gun fire by the 307 boys. Supper. I do not take meat. Have potatoes, peas, bread, coffee. A little distress in a few hours. I am too busily engaged writing to feel annoyed. The men are playing pinochle and disturb me for a while. Write until candlelight. Something is doing which has not yet been told us about. Men were to go out on patrol, but it was called off. About 10 o'clock, without any warning, Lt. issues orders that gas masks are to be worn at the alert position and, that as soon as it becomes necessary to move into the dugout, rifles and ammunition are also to be taken. We wonder what it is all about. There are no signs of an attack. Only activity is an occasional spurt of machine gun fire and the steady sending of shells from our guns at about ten minute intervals. There is much discussion and suspense and presently resume writing with my coat and mask on. Some of the boys have had to dress to comply with the Lt.'s order. They had remarked, one man in particular, that it looks like the night will be quiet and had removed all their clothes. It begins to rain. That ends the gas scare. It rains heavily for a few hours. The men go back to bed. I resume writing, remaining awake, alone in the room. At 11:00, Sgt. Stewart comes in to suggest that I put the lights out. It is shining through the window and can be seen from the street. I comply with his wish at once. Put out the light, open the window and lie down to sleep. My mind still insists on writing to Leah. It keeps on working and working, so that I cannot sleep. Had I a pen in my hand, I would have had written at least 3000 words, before the machinery stops. Milne, who has been sick all day with an illness similar to mine, is taken seriously ill and vomits. That effectually prevents me from shutting my eyes. He must 219go on guard in a half hour or so. It will soon be light, so I lie awake on my back waiting for daylight, when I will get up to continue writing. Milne goes on guard. I get up and dress fully. Go downstairs for a few minutes to get the air and keep the guard company. I have a dull pain in my back and kidney from constipation. My bowels have not moved today. I exercise thinking it will bring them back to normal. Decide there is something radically wrong with me, for since the beginning of the week, I have had diarrhea and now I am constipated. I will see the doctor at my earliest opportunity. I have gone downstairs without a blouse and it begins to feel chilly. I am on my way upstairs when I meet Sgt. Stewart. I have a question to ask him, and I would like to talk to him in general. He impresses me as a very fine fellow. We talk for more than fifteen minutes and as I look at him, I am impressed with his fine physique and exquisitely cut features. I confess that I admire him. We go upstairs together. Enter my room, intending to begin anew at my writing. Get my paper, fuss around a little with it. Read what I have already written, so that I can get back into the swing of it. Milne comes in, staggering from weakness, gasping for breath, He is in great pain from acute indigestion. I tell him to lie down, loosen his clothes to permit him freedom and suggest that he swallow a camphor and opium pill, which are handy on the table. They were prescribed by doctor. He feels better after taking one. I put back my paper, intending to lie down to be ready in case Milne needs me. He is in bad shape and I fear we will have to get a doctor for him, but I fall asleep and Milne does too. Sgt. Williamson of this detachment receives his commission. Other men in the regiment, also promoted.

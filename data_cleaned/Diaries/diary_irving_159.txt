Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 23 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Jul. 23, 1918 Weather: Raining, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. Get breakfast with F Co. Bread and Karo, coffee. A very poor breakfast, which I am fortunate enough to supplement with some sardines, which Ellbogen has. Nothing to do but wash and shave. After that I will write. A few boys go to work. Most of them play "cat" in the firebreak. Rifles, belts, bayonets, gas masks must be worn all the time. An hour in the morning, the gas mask must be worn. I get a board and write. Borrow ink pens from the boys. They would give me anything I want at any time. Paper is the only thing I cannot get and that is because there is none. I must go to the YMCA to get some. It is closed. I have enough to write for a few minutes. My eyes tired again and I must go to bed for a nap before I can do anything. Ask Gillece to wake me at 10:00. Lie down and promptly on time I am awakened. Finish letter to Leah and write one to Rachel, telling her of the death of Harry Schneider, describing how he died and letting her know that I went to his grave and said a prayer, while the guns fired a salute above us. Dinner, a good one for F Co. Good roast meat, potato, sauce, rice and raisins, coffee. There is a good deal of complaint with F Co.'s mess and its Mess Sergeant. He guards what he gets as if it were for his use only. Because he sees me, a new man on the line, he complains that he must draw an extra ration. I suggest he can squeeze one out of the lot for me. "Editorially speaking he can", says he. After mess there is nothing to do but write. Get off a letter to Becks and Esther Karmiohl. Five letters ready for mailing before nightfall. An afternoon without incident, quiet. Not an order is issued to me by anyone. My time is all and wholly my own. I can do as I please and I please to write. There is not enough time to do all I wish to. This is what the men have been doing since they came back from ........ . I have missed a lot. I have made a much bigger sacrifice than I imagined. They have had bathing, time to write, time to read and what I have been able to do has had to be done under the guise of being ill. To-day a detail of F Co. men are going out to locate lines and make maps. Some men have gone to the Company for mail 236and other things. The men go to ........ to straighten out blanket rolls. They will separate overcoats and underwear from the rolls and these will be forwarded to us. This has some bearing and significance on our next move, what, we do not know. But, does that indicate the mountains of Italy, Russia or some colder clime? There is much discussion about it. The victories of the Americans at Chateau Thierry is also dovetailed into the discussion. The general opinion is that the war cannot last long now. French hold likewise now. We hear of wagers made about the early ending of the world struggle. Supper is stew without potatoes, but plenty of green peas, a good substitute, bread, coffee. A single gun has been practicing apparently, all afternoon. Just aimless lazy firing. We have no intimation of what is going on outside. The woods are so thick that we cannot see out of them. After supper, it rains in torrents. The boys were again playing cat and are driven inside. I continue writing till nightfall and candles are lit. The boys are drinking "vin blanc". I am tempted to ask for a mouthful but that is all I can be induced to take. They procure the wine from Frenchmen who bring it to them under cover of the darkness, the bottles being carried in sand bags. They have champagne to sell too, but the boys have little money among them. I cannot give them any this month, as I have not yet been paid, nor have I collected any of the 100 Frs. that are due me from them. Have some sardines and canned peaches before I go to bed. I am offered some more wine by Black and Conway, who sit outside the door drinking out of a bottle they have between them. I try to find someone who will take some for the benefit of these two boys, who I am afraid will become badly intoxicated. No one wants any more. They are all in their bunks wondering why they are so hot and feel so talkative. A big, burly Frenchman comes in after the doors are locked, trying to sell champagne. He comes up out of the darkness outside, so suddenly that for a moment I am frightened and think he is a Boche. As soon as it gets dark, a rifle or a pistol shot is heard occasionally and once a spurt of machine gun fire. I cannot imagine where it comes from or the cause of the firing. It is in our own territory and there should be no occasion for it. A distant barrage is heard for about 10 minutes and I imagine I hear the hum of an aeroplane. A few distributed shots from the gun in the woods, which has done work earlier in the day and that is all we hear of the war for the day. To bed at 10, then change my mind about sleeping. There is too much noise and the bed is hard. Perhaps I ought to read for an hour or so? It is a long time since I have read a book. Maloy has been reading "That Printer of Udrels" today. It is by Wright and I have long been wanting to read one of his works. Light my candle again and lie on my back reading while boys shout, swear and fight among themselves. Days, with too much wine in him, is trying to explain to the men how many centimes in a sou and occasionally how many sous in a centime. Gillece takes a hand. Schlesinger, Syrop, Farrell, all try to straighten out the tangle. There is so much wrangling, that the guard outside must intervene and demand that quiet be maintained. He tells us that the officer of the day will punish us all severely, if we do not simmer down. The runners want to sleep and threaten to report Farrell. It quiets down and I blow out my candle. Others do likewise and in a few minutes one is able to sleep. I do not realize how tired I really am until I begin to say my prayers, fall asleep and wander into unintelligible things. Tallon comes in shortly after waking me and disturbing me. He wants to talk but I do not. He falls asleep soon and begins gnashing his teeth. It sends a chill down my spine. I must stop up my ears so that I cannot hear. All night long he disturbs me 237with it. It rains the greater part of the night. I feel sorry for C Co. in the lines again to-night. They have the worst luck of any company in the regiment it seems. They are getting their baptism of soldiering with a vengeance. Hear of promotions in F Co. Del Duca and Wall made Sgts., Guttenberger is sent back to the States, to act as an instructor. I envy him. Hear rather late that the French Government has called in all Napoleons. Have two of them without knowing about it. Difficulty in getting rid of them.

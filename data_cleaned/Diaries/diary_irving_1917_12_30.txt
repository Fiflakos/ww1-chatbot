Good. Hetty, Harry, Hy, Mollie, Mike and Ben Diamond call. They play cards, victrola. Goldstone recites Shamus OBrien and sings topical songs very well. I find that I grow tired if I stay awake after 9:00, so at 11:00, I announce that I wish to go to bed. Company goes. Leah and I talk shop and make plans for tomorrow. We say our prayers together, after discussing peace, talk in papers of today, in which Germany appears very anxious to conclude peace. Sleep poorly. Dreaming all night that I was back in barracks and that I have no right to sleep with Leah, whom I was endeavoring to put out of my bed or hide. It is very cold in bedroom and we find it hard to get warm.

Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 23rd November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 23rd. Thursday.We are preparing to move off again. At a grandparade of the transport section today all was in good orderand ready to leave.I am intent on writing tonight if only to fix upa reply to Angus Ferguson and a line to Bert.Bill's letter today was very pleasing. The threehouses acquired for l,050 seems a bargain right enough andif the world settles down to its normal footing shortly theseshould be worth money or at any rate a jolly good living forthe old folk. Even if the war continues South African miningfields are hardly likely to suffer as gold must be won to carry - 25 -on our end of the war; that being so, Johannesburg shouldnot go back. At the same time I wish that we owned thesame property in Sydney. There it would be more valuableand for the old folk more congenial.Today has been the best and brightest day we'vehad for a long time. I washed three woollen shirts, butowing to the darkness falling at A o'clock they had not timeto dry.Our bearer division has gone road making to fillup their spell from the trenches. This is better thanlounging around and will do them more good than parades,route marches and drilling, much as they may squeak aboutit. Anyhow, they will squeak and grumble at anything, soit doesn't much matter.

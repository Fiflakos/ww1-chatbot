Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 13 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Aug. 13, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. During the night I have thought of talking to the Colonel about myself. Breakfast. Hash, bread, coffee. Must bolt my food to get back to my tent in a hurry. They are waiting for me to get out on a manoeuver with Hdqrs. company, as a runner representing the Battalion. The Colonel's orders. He has tired of seeing us idle and lounge. I am in bad temper. I am thinking of what might have been. I don't care what happens to me, and then I think of Leah and Cecilie and Mama and I brace up. The youngest Lt. in the regiment is in charge of the liaison arrangements. He has a good imagination. The field beyond the railroad track is the battlefield. The railroad signalman's tower and house is the signal receiving station. I am a runner who will relay messages to Headquarters. My post quarter mile distant from the next. Loaf a half hour till the game is staged, sitting by the well, talking to the Frenchman who fills my canteen. A message for me to take to the next post. Get there as 279fast as I can and return leisurely. Waiting for further work to come my way, I watch aeroplane battles and shelling of the Boche planes which are attempting to come over. Probably observing manoeuvers we are executing. Orders come to stop the game and prepare to move. Back to my tent with the other men. Doherty has no orders. Lie down in order to write a letter to Mama, which I will keep about me until I can mail it. A tank load of mail comes in, but we do not know if it is destined for us. Everybody questions. All of us are beginning to miss the letters from home. Bothered by flies. Rig up a contrivance to swing from the roof of our tent and force them out. Talk to Doherty who is also writing home, under the shade of our tent, till time for dinner. The sky is clear blue against which aeroplanes cannot be seen. Their motors can be heard all morning, as can the exploding shells in the air. Many and many machines of both sides up and being shelled. None brought down as far as we can learn. Dinner. Canned salmon, string beans, hardtack, coffee. Newspaper man comes. We get rations for to-night's supper. Orders come to strike tents at 2 o'clock. Get busy immediately. That done, read the newspaper, which gives no news of importance in connection with this front, except that the ........ has been crossed by our men. Lie in the sun which is so hot that it burns. Try to sleep but the flies will not permit. Put a coat over my face and hands. It becomes altogether too hot. Officers are new. McCleary helps to load truck. I am permitted to sleep until the loading is complete. The Colonel permits the men to drink bottled mineral water, which otherwise he could have left behind. It is the same stuff we were warned not to drink yesterday. We get under way with Lt. Haas leading. He is new to me. Makes a poor impression, being too exact about makeup of our packs. We halt for a while to let a machine gun procession pass by. Off by the long road. Not long before the perspiration pours from me in a stream. We fall out in a high spot, where there is a cool breeze blowing. Where I would like to stop for fifteen minutes or so, we are given only five scant, before the lunatic, who leads the fast march, has us going again. Much German equipment and munitions scattered about in the woods, wagons, limbers, etc. Through a sandy road in the wood where the walking is extremely hard. Dust clogs my nostrils and parches my throat. For the next rest, we are treated more generously, getting ten minutes, quite necessary, for there is a big hill to climb. It looks as though we are being led all over the countryside. The Lt., as I suspect, does not know the road to where he is going. He asks two French wagoners. We climb up a big hill going around instead of across its crest, into the road leading into the forest, where the scouts rested yesterday morning. Instead of halting here or near this point, we go on up the road and then downhill again into ........ . Pass a dead horse in the square. Nothing left but the skeleton, which smells horribly in the heat of the fierce sun. This is what American soldiers in the town have for company. I am beginning to ask myself what of the vaunted superiority of the Americans in the matter of sanitation in his army camps. British headquarters is here, not so far away for the smell of horse not to be evident and what potency is lost, account of the distance, is made up for by the pile of putrid garbage in the gate of the house across the street. Here are all the dignitaries of the army that I know, and a few lazy ones. The Colonel is there. It looks like the regimental headquarters is to be established here. Find Doherty, who has been marching near the head of the column, and we ridicule the Lt. for the roundabout road on which he has conducted our march. But it is not over yet. Find to our disgust we do not halt here. Our home will be in the woods on the heights we 280just came down from. We swear heartily on the tiresome, tortuous climb uphill. More confusion until we are led into the path in the wood. Fifty yds. in we are halted and told to fall out, while our brilliant leader reconnoiters for a camp site. That is not of itself a laughable display of judgment, but, consider, we are resting where the bones of two or three horses decay in the sun. Our odors are fitting with the strength of the odor. We have taken our packs off and in five minutes they must be slung again to march for another half hour. We find the camp site, which is where the horse corral once was. There are German dugouts galore, little narrow trenches about a foot deep to accommodate from one to three men. These do not appeal to me. It reminds me too much of sleeping in a grave. Looking about for a tent site, we find some German newspapers, very evident misrepresentation of the war situation being the keynote of each editorial. I read the paper while Mac and Doherty look for a tent site. We will all bunk together. Growing dark we complete the construction of our abode for the night. What an old fuss Mac is for a boy. Everything must be just so and to his liking or it calls for a long speech from him. Next comes the question of food. Coffee is promised for 9 o'clock. The emergency rations we brought with us will have to be consumed, as it is too late to cook anything. This ration consists of a can of beans for eight men and a few biscuits apiece. We dig up eight men, who beg a can of beans before the man in charge of rations is quite ready to give them up. Procure our mess after an eloquent plea. It gives each of us only a few spoonfuls of beans. Ask Sgt. Roth particulars of order to send men back to the States and learn that it was not necessary to recommend a non-com. I could have been promoted for the orders, I am told by Sgt. Roth, who is an authority on army orders and paper work. That is another point of knowledge, the neglect to acquaint myself with, has worked to my disadvantage. I might have suggested that I be promoted or inquired of the Captain if I was to be promoted first. I am sad. Extremely sad. We are going into battle when I might be on my way home, perhaps. At nine o'c1ock we have coffee. After being sent back for my cartridge belt when almost to the kitchen. Then it is so dark that we cannot find our tent for some time. To bed without a much desired smoke, being afraid to light a match. Hell breaks loose soon after Mac has fussed himself to sleep. Doherty almost as bad. Both are so nervous that I must order them to sleep. An aeroplane out for destruction is above us. I do not much care what happens until I say my prayers, which gives me fresh courage. Barrages and shelling in addition to the Boche's work. He drops his bombs near us it seems. The morning will tell. Sleep fitfully. At two o'clock a gas alarm. consternation. I cannot find my mask for the time it takes me to take two breaths. A lot of excitement and no gas. Doherty, the most nervous man I ever met for a man who says his prayers as I know he does. When the turmoil is over, we sleep again. I wonder who it is that is gaining ground in the barrage.

Notes. 1 This is the same name that appears in the Aug. 25 entry. I cannot be sure of the spelling in either entry. This is a best guess. 1 For a complete history on the Juilly hospital go to this website: http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/memoir/Stretchers/Pottle3.htm 2 Actually the above referenced article states: The Collge was three times a hospital before the World War: First, during the war with England in 1790, then in 1814, when Napoleon, near the end of his career, was fighting on the Marne, and in 1870 when Juilly was occupied by the Prussians.

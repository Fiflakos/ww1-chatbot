Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 30th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 30th. Thursday.Nothing that I can recall (Saturday Dec. 2nd) isworthy of note today, as I don't remember going away from thecamp. I sometimes sit down to write but it is cold and tokeep the fire alight (coal fire in an oil drum brazier) seemsto occupy most of my time and attention. I try to get itburning brightly and free from smoke then take it inside thelow shack but it does not last long and-in putting more coalon there is the dense black smoke again. The roof of theplace, canvas, is now thickly coated with soot, in fact everythingis black, clothes, hat and my neck always so, evenimmediately after washing same.Harry Dingle came into Camp today and he and myselfare to join up with the 1st Battalion tomorrow.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. Jun. 14, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 5:45. Reveille. Captain wants every man in company to devote time between breakfast and 9 o'clock to washing clothes and if we are fortunate Major will find a brook where company may bathe later in the morning. Cheerful news, not because there are prospects of a bath (most of us have had one) but because there will be no drill. Breakfast a surprise. Our American rations, those Capt. told us to expect have come and for breakfast there is plenty. White bread once again, rice, jam, Karo syrup, butter, coffee and bread is all I get for being late in line. Tent taken down, wash a pair of socks and a dish towel. Air blankets. My work is done. I make an effort to write. Sun is too hot. I become drowsy and take a nap. Awakened by the whistle. Fall in with towel and soap. I have no underwear. Extra suit is in blanket roll which is lost. March out to a brook running along a patch of woods about a kilometre from town. Clear as crystal, slow moving, bottom seems a foot below surface though in reality it is two. Minnows playing in weeds along bank frightened at unaccustomed noise. Squat wherever we can find a comfortable spot to undress in. My underclothes very dirty, especially drawers. First man in kicks up a wave of mud. Reports water is cold. I am undeterred. This once I am not last. Some of these boys are probably more afraid of cold water than of bullets. Hang back for further reports. 4th man in. Cook watching performance. Step in and get a shock. Must not wince the least bit while he is looking. Splash about in muddy water for three or four minutes. Swim not better or worse than in surf at beaches near home. This water so cold that legs and feet become numb. I can even feel my insides being chilled. Lt. looks on and smiles, a rare thing for him where I am concerned. Make a remark about temperature of water after I am out. Draw a civil answer from him. He goes to join his cronies. I stand on bank. It is warm in sun. Swing my arms to keep off horse flies which draw blood when they bite. After five minutes I go in again, cake of soap in my hand. Soap up until soap falls into water. Search for it until I an nearly frozen. Come out. Dry myself. Dress, all but undershirt, which I wish to wash when I get back to camp. A German plane heard overhead. Lie down to sun myself. Find Lt. is inclined to let us go back as we please. I take advantage of his kindness at once. Through the woods all alone looking for things of interest and strawberries. Go astray for 5 minutes. Meet Wallert who tells me Haight wants to see me. My idea is he can want me for only 2 reasons, either to tell me that Lt. G. wants me at Division Hdqrs., or that my blanket roll has been found. Tease myself by not showing much outward concern and will wait until I am called again. Boys form in line for dinner half hour before call sounds. I must either take foot of line or work my way in. Do so. Good steak, potatoes, coffee, bread. A new spirit of independence among the men. They refuse to pay the price egg trust demands. Expect to drill in afternoon so make no attempt to leave camp. Write a letter to Leah. Lazy, drowsy, take a nap. Assembly blows, but it is only for non-coms. Thank the Lord. Another afternoon off. Sit in the shade of a tree to write. Traveling bazaar comes into square again. Good business today as yesterday. Del Duca comes up with 2 boxes of cigars, l carton of Velvet and some Sweet Caporals. That attracts my attention first, but there is something else about him that is of more importance. It is his manner. "Where are they?" he shouts. "They" are Goldsoll and Krause who got Fatima cigarettes and tobacco at ......... and sold them this morning at 30 or 100% profit. Del pulls a stake out of the ground and makes for Krause. Waiting only long enough to give a few words of explanation, he strikes him twice with the stake, strong blows over the shoulders. Then with his fist he strikes Krause in the face. "Give back every cent" he commands. "Where is the other ___?" Goldsoll at other end of the field tries to hide out cannot escape vengeance. He has a pack on his back, being punished for neglect of duty. That does not hinder Del from meting out justice. He strikes him to the ground and has difficulty restraining himself from kicking him. No one interferes. Both culprits shout for Sgts. who will not come to their rescue. Goldsoll puts up no defense. Hands over the profit he had made. Fox comes back with a dozen cartons of Fatimas and sale of cigarettes and tobacco at NY City prices. Men who paid double prices in morning have money refunded. I suspected there was profiteering at previous sale and could not be induced to buy anything. Even went so far as to tell men my suspicions. They were out of cigarettes and would pay any price. Everybody agrees that Del Duca was right to beat men. Write a letter to Mama. Supper. Beans and meat stew, bread, coffee. Wash my shirt. Start a letter to Matt and the boys. Write until it is dark. Make bed and go to sleep at 10 in silence. Sleep well. Lt. C. up until 12 pulling down tents just for fun. A traveling tinker comes to town. A bellows, a handful of coal, a soldering iron, a bench, a stool. He is ready for work. Collects all the dippers and pots and pans in the village that need repairing. A rich country. So much fruit that there is no objection to men taking as much as they please. Plums, cherries, gooseberries, currants, grapes. Looking dawn into the valley from the plateau, fields of green, patches of brown, clumps of woods, blue mountains in the distance, a village shows its red gables to the right of me, one to the left, a sky of clear blue with fleecy white clouds. In the village, two very old women, on a bench outside their window, knitting, greet me as I pass. Old men arguing volubly. Children looking at me in wonder, an intruder upon the peace and quiet of their home. A rifle range built by Lt. Griffiths. Shave and clean gun and bayonet before I go to bed. Lt. C. watching. Our mascot goat is climbing up walls of tents. They are mountains to him. Antics amuse everyone. Himpler, Black, Maloy, Sgt. and Lt. go up to new front tomorrow for observation. Somewhat displeased at not being among the chosen. Rather let a man, who is interested in strife to the extent of wishing to get into it, go, than one who would merely like to observe. They are happily singing themselves to sleep.

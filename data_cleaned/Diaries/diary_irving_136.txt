Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 30 June 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Jun. 30, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good "Greenwald". "Yep". Rub my eyes. It is the Lt. " Yes Sir", I correct myself. "I want you to go to ........ with the morning report. Get ready!" "Yes Sir. It is 5:30. I am to go on a bicycle. No time to wash. Look for a pistol to arm myself with. None to be found. I take only my belt. More adventure. I imagine I must run a gauntlet of fire, and will have to display a great deal of courage. Long time since I have been astride a bicycle. Down hill at once. I like my job. All I must do is sit in the saddle and ride down hill. Meet Cohn, who has a message that I should have taken at Hdqrs. at 5:45. A most enjoyable ride for a morning constitutional. No opportunity to display bravery. No harrowing fire to ride through. Touring the country, it seems to me. I do remember caution enough to keep close to camouflage screen along road. Many aeroplanes up and being fired at. Upward of 100 shots fired at them. In ten minutes I am halted by guard to whom I give password. In another minute I am before Major with report. Give Leah's letter into the care of Sgt. Major, who promises to see that it is mailed. On my way back, guard does not halt me this time. Instead he asks for a match. I try to go uphill on bicycle. Decide to get off and walk; a rest for my thighs. A few coasting stretches, but most of the time I walk uphill beside the bicycle. Last stretch of road a downhill coast and a short uphill into town, which I ride by zig-zagging, arriving out of breath, and wet, at quarters. To pump in square to wash and shave. A deserted village if there ever was one. Not until I am finished do I see anyone. Meet some of our Company men. Ration dump in store below. Corporal in charge is still asleep. We wake him to get rations for breakfast. Kitchen across road in lodge of chateau. Bean stew and coffee, made yesterday is being reheated. There are a few large pieces of bread and beef there, which have been in gas recently and is unfit for consumption. The place is filthy with garbage and dirt. Upstairs are high explosives, stored away in a corner. The bean stew is sour. The coffee is fair and with bread and Karo makes my breakfast. Make plans for setting things in order. Sweep out thoroughly. Dispose of decaying garbage and all useless cans and tins, bags, etc. Conway constitutes himself cook and begins making dinner. I run through chateau looking for ink. Find many valuable articles, I wish could be sent home as souvenirs. An old quarte French and Latin dictionary 16 -- . I take it with me to my room. Write for an hour. Get wood and chop it. Take a nap or rather try to, disturbed by flies and one of our anti-air guns directly behind us, which has a target in the sky. Give it up as a bad job and go to kitchen to wait for mess. Kapek, our old cook, and Deyo, KP at ......... , have joined our detachment and have been assigned to take charge of the mess, which assures us of good meals. There is roast beef hash, potato, bread, Karo, coffee. As soon as Lt. finishes his lunch, he assigns Himpler and me to relieve Black and Maloy at the ........ OF. I am shaky in the knees. I expect to have to fight for my life every second of my day. 194Lt. takes us out, equipped with rifle belt, bayonet, mask and glasses. Through an alley into the trenches. I expected them to be 4 ft. wide, higher than my head, cut out of earth. They are wide enough to allow only one to pass, shored up on both sides, boardwalk floor, camouflaged on top, winding till I become dizzy following their course. Come out into a lit and upon a well camouflaged OP. A narrow door and inside as safe as an office. A map, telephone, watches, glasses, etc. Platform and chair for observer. Table and chair for recorder. All built into the earth, bullet proof. Black and Maloy half asleep. A Frenchman is supposed to be about. He is asleep on the parapet behind OP. Relieve men, get a half hour's instructions. Left to ourselves, finding it quite pleasant, nothing in particular to do, fear leaves me. I take up post as observer. Look upon an intricate trench system, strange to us. No evidence of German occupation. Directly in front of my glass, in No Man's Land, is a little white wooden cross. Only thing to suggest that man has been here. I take it upon faith that he is here now. Frenchman comes in. Quite a cheerful person. I must begin to practice on him. The job begins to appeal to me. Himpler observes. A good opportunity to write. I had no idea war was like this! Observing again. Bang! A cloud of smoke. It is coming in through peep hole. Whew! Gas! Non gas", cries the Frenchman. "Explosif". "Gas", hoarsely to Himpler. We take out our masks. "Damn that Frenchman. He is as cool as ice". I breathe another whiff of smoke. Look at Himpler and the fire-eater and put my mask back, all atremble. In a minute, Bang! Bang! Bang! Behind OP earth and small stones shower into our doorway. Houses of the town obscured from view by smoke. More courageous this time, enough to remember that I am expected to find out where they hit, calibre of shell, direction of fire, etc. Aided to make notations and map readings by Frenchy. He is relieved by another, who sings and whistles most of the time. I get along well with him too. Jerry sends more pills back of town on road. No casualties. We return the compliment with 35 to 40 75s to ........ . A puff of smoke from a trench. I have heard no whizz. Ask Frenchy what it is. He says it is our shelling and not in trench but miles behind. I agree with him. Another. A puff of yellow, in another. Now he is convinced. Put it down as a hit on German lines. Quiet except for aeroplanes which are fired at. I read photoplay magazine. A third Frenchman comes. He is not as willing to teach me French as the others. He only signs and whistles and reads. Run out to look at aero battles. Relieved by Wade and Howe at 7:15. On way to quarters meet Kandel and Weinhold, who tell us one of our outposts was hit. Herman and Newberger badly scared. See at once that what I reported as a hit on German lines was a hit on ours. Explain circumstances to Lt. when I see him. Ask if shelling has done any damage in town. None. Glad of that. Men in the trenches are hungering. Kitchen is overtaxed, being burdened with an order to ration 168 extra men. No casualties, Thank God. Kapek and Deyo have worked wonders in the kitchen. It is clean, well arranged and sanitary. Roast beef hash, apple sauce, biscuits and coffee for which we must wait. A satisfactory supper. Men are all assembled in our room. I cannot write. No ink. I will read, something I have not done since leaving ........ . Sewell Ford's torchy stories. Three surplus rifles, which have been issued to E boys, are being cleaned by them. Candles are lit. Windows sealed. Guard and OP details for the night are announced by the Lt. I am free to sleep as soon as I care to go to bed. Read till 10. Make bed and turn in with my shoes on. Men talk and argue. Those that want to sleep are peeved. Heated discussion. Ward has a box of Left's hard candies from the States. He passes 195it around. It is good. I take more and promise everybody a treat when I get my packages. Hot in bed. Room is as close as a tomb. I take off shoes, stockings and leggings. Tempted to remove all my clothing. Of what use is a bed if I cannot remove my clothing? It is two, almost three months since I have slept in my underwear. 4 months ago, I last slept in pajamas. I would like to risk it. Being tired, I fall asleep debating the question. Lights are out. All the men are asleep. The air is so foul and thick that I cannot sleep. I awake in an hour. Shout that I want the window open. Not to be thought of. There is a weight on my chest. I am too accustomed to tent life to stand this. Bed is not so comfortable, after all. I remain hot, roll and toss all night. The book I found is my pillow. It is too hard. I get rid of it. No better. Nothing occurs during the night. A few bursts of machine gun fire. Hear a story describing action of Rogers and Hussey upon sighting a German and what Del Duca does subsequently. My admiration for Del grows. Lt. out till past twelve. He has had no sleep for the past two nights and asks to be awakened at 4. He is the hardest worker in the army. Never complains. Never takes advantage of a minute in which to rest, or do something for himself. Modest withal.

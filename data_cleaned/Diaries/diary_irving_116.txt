Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 9 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. Jun. 9, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Hike .... Kilometres to ......... Up at 5:30, feeling much refreshed. Feet in good condition. Breakfast. Pork and beans, bread, cocoa, jam. Beans are hard when mess call is blown. We wait for them to be cooked. Announced that we do not move this morning. Transportation cannot be arranged for. Move at 3 PM. Captain wishes men to stay in vicinity of camp and rest up for a nine mile hike, expected to be completed by 7 PM. We will rest and have supper and entrain at 12 PM for an unknown objective. Shave and police. Begin to write and fall asleep with pen in my hand, shortly. Sleep for more than an hour. Write until mess call blows. Dinner. Stew, hardtack, coffee. Order to strike tents immediately after mess. Roll pack. Blouses will be worn. It is quite cool. Somewhat cloudy sky. I am decidedly worried at prospect of hiking nine miles. To ease my feet, I think it well to bathe them before I leave, change to my old hiking shoes and see that I have a pair of good heavy socks on. Strike tent and roll pack, assisted by Rubin. At this juncture Company E is everlastingly disgraced by clique of drinking Irishmen. The knowledge that a long hike was proposed should have kept them from drink for their own comfort, if nothing else. I look up from my work to see Devlin, Hackett and Gillece in a brawl. Gillece drunk as a pig. Hackett and many others too. Hackett strikes Gillece a blow on the mouth which draws blood. Devlin, with probably the best of intentions tries to make peace. Gillece will not listen and to make matters worse insults Devlin who strikes him over eye. Gillece badly cut over eye, blood all over face. An Italian lad angered by Devlin's dastardly deed makes for him with a mattox and a general fight ensues which must be stopped by officer. Rumor spread in battalion that all of Co. E. is drunk. Almost true as a matter of fact. Gillece patched up at infirmary. Company formed and starts promptly on time. Walk 45 minutes at a quick pace without a trace of foot discomfort. Everybody stands up well. Even the drunken ones. Gillece a great surprise. Villages passed poor in the extreme. Beautiful country. Up hill and down. See a young colt for the first time. Wonderful poppy fields. Cultivated hillsides. Wheat and rye all around us. Hike 50 minutes and rest for 10. March completed in 3 and a quarter hours, passing through ........, a fine town, with asphalt pavement on main street and two or three large chateaus besides a railroad station and factories. Excellent little shops of every kind. Boys march through in fine shape but hint they would like to fall out to permit them to see town sights. English quartered there. Fresh and pleased at the termination of hike, we rest in a boggy field, having supper. Cheese, bread, jam, coffee. Seconds, in which I draw a quarter loaf of bread, pound of cheese and some jam. Non-coms only permitted to visit town to make purchases. Nothing can be bought except liquor. E Co. makes a record purchase. A little rain shower. I get out to take a look around town. Evidences of a wealthy town. Chateaus and shops, railroad station, River ........ and canal bridged by what looks to be American engineers work. A disappointment as to size of river (it is only 50 feet wide) but of exceeding beauty, with trees lining both sides. Details out to take care of rations for trip. Assembled at 8, many absentees. A number of men must be carried to station where we lie in dusty road on our packs until 1 AM. A larger supply of liquor obtained. I sit for 2 hours chatting with 1st Sgt. Haley. He, too, is disgusted with conduct of men. I find he once was in paper business. Train pulls in at 12. Wagons and cookers loaded on flat cars, horses and rations. 25 men to a car. I am unfortunate in getting into one which is full of horse dung at both ends, almost a foot deep at walls, soft, wet, foul- smelling stuff. Never in my life so disgusted. We search for candles and get to work immediately shoveling it out. What an awful job and how little I think of the men who permit such conditions to prevail. We clean up fairly well and steal a dozen large planks to lay over wet floor, from a private yard near station. Think we are justified in doing so. Rations drawn for entire trip. They are placed in corner. Men flop wherever they can find room. It is cold and chill. They must unroll packs to get blankets. Done in harness. I have only a little space to sit in corner on a pack and a sheaf of marsh grass which I picked to use as bedding. My eyes shut, but I awake in 15 minutes and thereafter cannot sleep. Getting accustomed to foul smell. After 2 hours of excitement in station loading transport we put out at 3. Day is breaking. Ride along course of river. Large towns passed. Architecture becoming more pretentious. Stand up looking through grating until 6. Eat a jam sandwich. Sit down and fall asleep. Have not seen any aircraft nor heard a gun all day. What a shame that such beautiful country, as we are passing through, should be devastated by war. Realize that La Belle France is not a misnomer in the few hours I spent looking through the grating. Men in car a pitiful sight to behold. Uncomfortable, restless, cold. Horses and cattle are better housed than we are and yet we die for glory on the battle field.

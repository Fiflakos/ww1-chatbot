Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 21 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Jul. 21, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Warm Health: Good Up at 4, after a night of little rest, cold and stiff and sore. I had just a faint hope that I would not be called. Most of us go down to the kitchen to work. One plays sick and a few hide or disappear after they have reported. Before we have our own breakfast, we take the mess to the boys in the lines. I go with the Greek corporal. I am shown consideration by the Sergeant, who suggests that I carry the bread only, because I shouldered the coffee twice yesterday. I am given a can of syrup too. It leaks, so it is put in a pail. Half way down the street, the corporal calls to my attention that the pail leaks too. The syrup has run down my clothes, my coat. My trousers, my leggings and shoes are all sticky. A fearful mess. I scrape some of it off with a knife, put a handle of iron on the pail and carry my burden carefully and gingerly for the rest of the journey. The way seems shorter than yesterday, so at a certain point I cannot believe I am near and think I have gone wrong, and promptly do so. I make a detour, which costs me fifteen minutes of anxiety and valuable time, before I get back. I try to hide in a snipers post to escape the job of taking the mess to the outposts, which are a mile of trench distant. It is an unsuccessful ruse. I 232must go. The walking is good. A deep trench except in a few spots, which have been caved in by shells. Disgusted with the war before I get to our destination with Tommie and a Sergeant to guide us. Before I get back, I am worse in the dumps. As we leave the post to go back, we meet a party of three coming from another post. One of the men is from the ........th, from a raiding party, which has been out in the night. He became detached from them in the dark and lost his way. Out all night in a shell hole and wanders into our sector as soon as it is light. We head to the road which will take him to his mates. Back in the kitchen at 7. Have breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee with milk and a few prunes, which I steal. My only wish now is to get some sleep. I have a copy of the Stars and Stripes. Lie down on the couch in the parlor, read the paper and would have fallen asleep at once if it were not for the flies. I use my newspaper as a screen and manage to get an hour and a half's sleep. Corporal comes looking for a detail. He does not disturb me. I am grateful. Begin a letter to Annette. Finish it before mess. Corporal does not disturb me to carry noon mess to the lines. Dinner a good one. Roast beef, potatoes, bread, crullers, coffee with milk. Back to write a letter to Leah. I may be disturbed to go on detail, which is to carry reserve ration back into the reserve lines. It begins to rain, which postpones the corporal's call for a half hour or so. He comes when the rain stops. On wheel barrows we must move 58 cases of reserve ration, which weigh 107 pounds apiece. An awful job. The ordeal is prolonged by the supply sergeant in charge, who misleads us. I am afraid we will be seen by Jerry, OBs and shelled. Not an unusual proceeding with them. Wheel barrows break down, we sweat like the devil, we swear and rest frequently. I have a load of 4 cases on a rickety barrow with the aid of two other men to help push. Over hill we need 7 men to pull our load. After 2 hours we are at the dugout, which will hold the cases. There we are told we will not have to carry mess into the lines. Some of the men start back. I do not trust in the promised release from the unpleasant job and hang back. Get my mess kit and take barrow back to the kitchen. The mess has not been taken out yet and the order is that the first man finished will have to go out. I have always been a slow eater. I am always last to finish eating. There are quite a few discussions and fights among the men on account of the order. One party starts out. The other to the farthest post, cannot be procured. The men refuse to go. I remain passive, say nothing. Get back to quarters unseen. Mess Sgt. sends orderly with an order from Capt. for two men. Refusal means severe punishment. I argue out of it. Take off my shoes and stockings to apply ointment on my sore feet, which are growing worse. Have the Sanitary man bandage it for me and change my socks. As a result of the refusal of the men to take the mess out, we must all move to a building near the kitchen to be under the orders of the Mess. Sgt. I get ready to go, picking up my stuff, putting it into a shelter half, without making a pack. On the way downstairs I meet one of the men who tells me I am to be dismissed. Joy. Mess Sgt. tells me I am free and to report to Company Hdqrs. Also gives me my mail. 4 letters from Leah, one from Morris, Lottie, Esther Karmiohl, Rachel, and a wedding invitation from Mandy. It strikes me as humorous. A Sgt. will accompany me to Hdqrs. It is a wonderful moonlit night, but warm. I am wringing wet by the time I get up the hill. There I find no one from my company has called for me, which is necessary before I am released. I must go back to town. In the meantime, the Sgt. has a lot to talk about to the officers. I read all but one of my letters. All good news, thank God. Pictures of Morris and Florence. A touching note from Papa 233written by himself. An action in the lines, which sounds like trench mortars were working. Does not last long, but Lt. is worried. Seems close or in his sector. Go back at 11:30. A most wonderful moonlit panorama below. The town seen as in daylight. Can see to read by the light, so bright is it. The Sergeant is nervous. He is afraid we will be seen and sniped at. I tell him we are within our own lines. He starts at the sound of our footsteps on the gravel and at every shadow and noise. In the town again, I do not know where the men are, so I step into the place where the runners bunk. Ask for a place, which is given me gladly. Sit at their table and smoke their cigarettes, read the last letter. We talk again of Harry Schneider, and from a description of a man one of the boys saw dead after the C Co. action on the 24th, I am sure Harry died. I am touched beyond the power of speech to describe. Silent after the news is told me. Get a mattress, go to bed after 12. Anxiously awaiting the morning to go to Harry's grave. There is more activity to-night than for a long tine. I am afraid it will develop into a major operation for this front and think of the men in the lines and the distance they have to retreat to safety. Afraid to tell Leah about the death of Harry. Worried that she will think I am in grave danger, but I must tell, so I will give the news to Rachel. Leave word not to wake me for breakfast. I can, almost at any time get a piece of bread and a cup of coffee from the kitchen. ........th makes a daylight secret raid with 50 men of which only 10 return without a mark. 35 dead and the Captain. A manoeuver which starts an investigation. A reckless piece of business.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 20 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Jul. 20, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Good Everybody up and on the job at 4 in spite of pretests. They don't go with this outfit. Because it takes a little longer than Lt. thinks it should to get outside, he comes for the Corp. to inquire why. He himself comes in to order some of the men out, and as a result we are told we will all pay the penalty. The Capt. 230comes down, too, to look us over. He does not approve of grinning and thinks our jobs should he made more difficult because Smith grins. To begin with, we will get no breakfast until mess is delivered to the boys in the lines. We are paraded to the kitchen and on the way up I have some very serious thoughts. I realize that it is best to go through with this thing, and complain after, so I say nothing to Capt. This is my last day anyhow. To-morrow should see me back with my company. At the kitchen everything is ready. Cans of bacon and coffee strapped into carriers are put on the backs of men. I take 4 empty bacon cans to be used for taking mess to the outposts. One group of men to GC5 - my group to GC6. A long walk, hot and dangerous. I think what a sin it is to make a husband and father take such risks, unarmed. I could kill the men that gave these orders. A dozen times I almost break my neck by banging my steel helmeted head against the upper cross pieces of shoring. Sweating like a "bull" is supposed to sweat. Arrive at post without incident, one place passed, pointed out by corporal as the point which was made a target by MG last time they were up. Is this not a horrible predicament for me to be in? At post is a fussy looking Lt., who calls everything a "damn thing". He is disliked by all the men. The plan they have for feeding men on post is that we take the food up to them in the bacon cans. A corporal assigned to the task of showing us the way. He goes astray two or three times, as who would not, in these ditches. The mess is cold when we get to the first post we serve. I wait while corp. and man serve two others. Then we go back to the starting point for cans and carriers. Ten Allied planes have gone over early in the morning on a bombing expedition within the German lines. They are coming back amid shell fire, as we emerge from Central, minus one of their number. In the kitchen for mess. Plenty of bread, Karo and coffee, but no bacon. We complain. Cook fries some for us. He does not know what he is doing. Takes him 15 minutes to find something to fry bacon in. If he puts a thing down, he forgets where. Strikes me as a very queer person. While we are messing, some more of our planes go up. They are peppered with German HE before they can get across right ever our heads. It rains iron into the streets of the town. I will not even go out. I advise all the men it is best to keep indoors. None of them obeys. There is an OB up and they may be seen, for he is looking right down the main street of the town. The din is about as big as any I have ever heard. The entire town shakes. The ruins shower brick and whatever else is loose. When it is all over I go to quarters. Two planes are still up drawing fire. I write and rest until it is time to go out with noon mess. I catch Smith, whom I suspected of prying into my things yesterday, in the act of opening the folder which contains pictures of Mama and Papa. Promise to thrash him unless he goes downstairs at once. He goes without a word other than the excuse that he is looking for paper. I tell men to be on the watch for him. Mess of bacon, tomatoes, bread and coffee. I take a can of coffee to GC5, the shortest trip. Cover is not screwed down tightly and contents spill all over me. I have a fight in my efforts to have it fixed. It cannot be done, so I take it through the Boyau. My clothes absorb as much sweat as coffee. Shame surges through me. Drunkards are supposed to do this work, not I. There the men from the post come for their own mess. It is served to them from dixies. Go back empty handed. Have a good dinner of corn, bacon, coffee with milk, bread and syrup. To quarters, write barefooted in bed. Rest an hour or so. An occasional fire from the guns behind us, which in the morning were quite active. O'Keefe and De Andrea bring up McKeon and O'Connell from E to join the prison gang. They tell me there is mail for me and my heart 231aches to read it. I am angry with them for not bringing it. They did not know I was here. Nobody does and it surprises them. Get news from Co. Ready for supper trip. Wait for it while I talk to boys in Cafe next to kitchen. Hear a shot fired. Pay no attention to it, because it is quite frequent that someone draws his rifle. By joining Lt. 10 minutes later, I go out to see if mess is ready and find an excited group in the kitchen. The cook, who I thought acted queerly in the morning, has attempted to blow his brains out. He has succeeded in tearing away his gums, teeth, lips and part of his nose. Lies in bed, a gory sight, conscious, brushing away flies, which are on his face, Lt. and Captain ministering to him. I am not much affected by the sight, nor do I sympathize with the man. Boys, who know him, tell me the troubles which worried him. Take coffee to GC5 again. Keep dry this time. It begins to cloud up. A shower is imminent but passes over. Back empty. Supper. Corn, bread, syrup, coffee and milk. To quarters to write. I have made inquiries about being permitted to leave for my company quarters to rejoin them. Captain does not know particulars of my case. I am disappointed. A gale blowing now. Sky clear. A fine sunset. Get a canteen of water. When I come back, begin a letter to Antoinette by candlelight. Corporal comes with awful news that we are wanted for work. Complaints do not help. We must go. Respect Capt. To Chateau to pick up bedding rolls of officers and carry them to Hdqrs. in wood on stretchers and a sheet for pack. When that is finished, we carry ammunition till 11:30. A ticklish job. My thoughts are not in harmony with the bright moonlight night. At finish I meet Capt. and ask him when I am released. He does not know. Wants me to follow him to look up record. Find that date of committal only is posted opposite my name, which means I must stay until he can get in touch with Lt. Griffiths. Must be up at 4 in the morning. In my bunk at 12. The wind howls. There are no windows to shut and I lie in a tremendous draft all night. Awake most of time. Hear unofficially that Harry Schneider was one of the victims in C Co.'s tragic affair last month. I make inquiries but no one is sure. They think so. Town now completely evacuated but for a few dozen men. New corporal in charge of prisoners proves to be a good fellow.

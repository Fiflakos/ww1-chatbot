Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 6th October 1914. Nationality: Australian. Oct 6 thTuesday.We are this morning preparingfor a march through the City. The fellows arekeenly looking forward to it and are nowbustling round in great expectation, itreminds me in a little higher level of theanxiety surrounding the preparation for aSunday school picnix.The grand march past for whichthe public have been clamouring for weeksis now over, and from observations Imad believe it was a wonderful success.We filed out of Moore Park aboutthe appointed time (11.45 a.m.)and from this point the whole routewas thickly lined with people.The Army Medical Corps were lastin the procession but nevertheless theycame in for applause and complimentarycriticism. We broke away from themain body at Darlinghurst at 1 o'clockafter 1 hours a of hot but pleasantmarching. Going though Macquarie St. where our Doctors are so well knownwe had a great reception particularly fromthe Hospital. Many of the people providedfruit for the troops the skins of whichcovered the Oxford St. It was verythoughtful indeed. I did not noticethe artillery guns in the march, andthis, from my own view point, is themost important weapon and the mostinspiring looking object in this warbusiness.At night a party of fellows went tothe picture show in charge of anofficer. They paid their own wayThe Colonal was very pleased atour showing to-day and complimentedthe company on parade on ourreturn to camp but he did notgrant any leaveW.Z came out by tram we hadtea at Coogee and arrived back incamp at 9.20. She is very fine and itwas a shame for her to go right back to Manlyalone. No leave

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 1 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wednesday May 1, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Cold Health: Good, Leg a trifle better Up at 5:45. Reveille. First platoon on line for breakfast. Good bacon, bread, coffee. Third platoon on police duty. Our squad detailed to regimental headquarters. Pleased at that because orders for drill are to roll short packs containing one blanket, condiments and bacon can. Helmet and mask also. Delighted with prospects of a day's freedom from fatiguing drill. Get our overcoats on, start off up road, intercepted by 1st Sgt. Must return, roll packs and fall out with company. Regimental order to witness an exhibition of some kind. Crestfallen lot. Promise of easy task in afternoon. Packs weigh as much almost as when full. Come to conclusion that it must be ammunition which is so burdensome. Company hikes off through village, Colonel with us, mounted. Reprimands Acting Major Whitehouse for tardiness. Maintain a good pace along worst road to vicinity. It is main road through village used by heavy trucks. Perspire freely. March to hollow just below village where exhibition was witnessed last week. Form in square, entire battalion. Colonel shouts down from road, orders to move to field above road on other side. Manage to get there with an effort. Stack arms, unsling equipment. Form around field in square formation. Same platoon as last week to show English drill discipline. Tedious morning inspection gone through, close order work, sentry drill, necessary drill. Marching good and bad, organized singing. Bayonet work. Having become warm and wet from exertion of marching, it is trying to stand still in cold damp wind. Move about whenever possible. Run. Slap each other on back, cut capers. Colonel immensely pleased with work of Englishmen. Compliments Lieutenant quite heartily on work of his platoon. To our mind while they have a better system, our old fluid platoon would drill better than they. Bayonet work far better than any we have ever done. Singing, while not a martial accomplishment, excellent, catchy airs. Over at 11. In harness again for a long hike to rifle range, where our squad gets instruction in Lewis gun. Rest of company with bayonet. Company formed for return to billets at 11:30. Relieve ourselves of equipment and go up with mess kits for formation. Payroll to be signed. Runs alphabetically giving me an opportunity to eat early. Beef stew, hard tack, coffee. Second helping. Just room for more. Some men, last in alphabet, must go without dinner to be on time for another battalion formation at 1:15. Our part of 3rd platoon having extra distance to travel comes up to find company gone. Make inquiries about direction they took. Follow and make up rear of Company H to end of village and up road to hill behind. Stack arms and leave equipment in road. File into meadow where there is an auto and a number of English officers and one Scotchman. After a few preliminary remarks, the latter, a Capt. of Gordon Highlanders, makes an appeal to us to acquire the spirit of the bayonet. Quick thinking, and with charming animation he tells us how and why and wherefor of bayonet. Yet in spite of its brilliancy his talk arouses in me only resentment that such a cruel killing instrument as the bayonet is used in war. He talks for an hour and a half including practical demonstration with welterweight champion of England assisting. A delightful view of villages below from our point of observation. March to drill field off main country road where our company goes over French course for benefit of an English officer and 2 Lt. Cols. of our army. If our men fight the way they worked the last fifteen minutes we will go west very soon. Complaint from all sides about how little consideration Captain has for his men. Not content with what has already been done, on way back to billets we go in patrol formation. I am one of connecting files. As I pass along road outside of English camp, our Colonel and two English officers of high rank pass. I salute promptly. An English lance corporal inside camp enclosure standing with hands in pockets looking at aeroplane in sky, curvetting, does not notice party. He is called to attention by his countrymen officers who rein up their horses giving him a severe reprimand, taking his name, swearing at him for his breach of courtesy. Back at 4:30. Wait in courtyard for retreat at 5:00. Back with equipment. Came up for supper which is held up for an hour, owing to lack of bread. When rations finally appear, English will not give us bread without order. Asked wait or take our bread ration in morning, which we decide to do, getting only bully beef, a slice of cheese, a spoonful of marmalade and coffee. Wash. Write for an hour. Go to village in search of chocolate to fill void in stomach. Find none. Come back and go to bed. Sleep well. No evidence of activity from front all day. Very quiet. Aeroplanes up only on practice flights. A few fly over drill field at morning exhibition, going slowly and at low altitude to see what is going on. Note at Englishman's exhibition drill that if a man has any trouble with equipment or commits an error, he immediately steps out of ranks and goes through work correctly in full view of company. They are quite honest about it.

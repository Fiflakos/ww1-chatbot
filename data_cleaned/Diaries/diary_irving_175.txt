Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 8 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Thu. Aug. 8, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Hike 3 kilos to ........ Up again at 6:00, sore in limb and cold. Go to the door to have a look around. We are passing through flat, level country over which hangs a low, thick mist, making it impossible to see more than a few hundred feet. But what we do see is not a very pleasant sight. We see graves, thousands of them all over the plains by the railroad tracks, by the roadside, in among the trees, where there are a few, by the side of the stream. All we see, men buried where they fell on a bloody battle field. Nearly all Frenchmen, who lie buried here. Single graves, double and triple graves, and in a few places larger plots, all well kept with a railing around each, a little wreath, a wooden cross, and the emblem of France on a circular cardboard from which hangs a ribbon, tricolored. A flag flies on some of the mounds, which is faded from the rains. On the plains, wheat, rye and oats grow around the dead, most of it newly cut and tied in stacks left to dry. Passing a town there are dead in a truck garden which has been cultivated up to the very edge of the grave. No one disturbs the dead. They lie where they have fallen, by the railroad track, close to the ties, so close that our legs which hang as we sit on the floor of the car by the door, almost graze the crosses that mark the graves of the men who rolled down the low embankment. We see coolie laborers again, who are building and fixing roads. They live in barracks, hundreds of them. Big six inch guns and gun carriages, monster 10 and 11 inch guns mounted on railway trucks, ponderous, solidly built trucks that impress one with the power that lies within them. Big shells almost as tall as a small man, so wide around that it would be difficult to encircle them with one's arms. They must be lifted into the guns by cranes, they are so heavy. A French camp of barracks, which stretches for kilos on both sides of the tracks, a hospital, captured German guns, damaged and salvaged guns of our own, and piles of aeroplanes, engines, planes and bodies, stores, trucks and a thousand other things of war. But every inch of ground bears grain or potatoes or something else. No doubt now, where we are going. I look at the map to see where we are now. Most of the men are up now. They are asking about breakfast. We make no stops for more than an hour, then we stop at ........, a large station where are civilians and soldiers. Good to see prosperous looking, cleanly dressed men and women; but all in black; old-faced people they are. Seems that they are seeing their sons, brothers and husbands off to the front again, after their furloughs. There is a chance to buy a French newspaper, fill our water bottles and wash. Have breakfast. Bully beef, pork and beans and hard tack biscuits (French use bread). All anxious for a cup of hot coffee, but none in sight. We wait patiently for a coffee stop, nursing our thirsts as best we can. Some drinking cold water. I smoke my pipe to quench my thirst. Level country mostly, little water, few hills. At ten-thirty we stop for breakfast. Some trouble getting somebody to 268believe we should be fed. I get a cup of coffee and some bread and bacon. The train starts before I can get back to my own car. Make a stop where the train crew and the officers get their orders. After that we are not allowed to get off the train when it stops for water. Many guesses where we are going, because we are close to and on the road to Paris. Pass some American boys bathing in a brook. Shout to them to find out who they are. Much surprised to hear they are first battalion men of our own regiment. This means that we stop close by, right behind the ........ lines. Our transport waiting for us at the next station. Then I lie down to take a nap as there is nothing more to see. Use the pack of a medical man for a pillow . Disturbed in a few minutes when the order comes to get pack ready. I fix up mine. Order comes that canes may not be taken with us. Hate to lose mine; it has been a great help to me. We get off the cars. Orders are very strict regarding the general police of the men. I am told to button up and asked to fix a lot of minor details. We have an hour and a half to walk to our billets, we are told. Get to the head of the street where the column is halted, because there is a trainload of Italian soldiers sprawled across the road. A load of French just pulling out in the opposite direction, riding in compartment coaches. Chaff between the French, Italian and Yankees make it look like a lively picnic scene. There comes word that our billeting orders have been changed. From ........ we go to ........ which is a shorter walk. Uphill through beautiful little town as pretty a little place as ever we have been in. Stores of all kinds, a market, solidly built houses and a substantial bridge. Very hot hiking. The sun is out full strength, so the doctor orders just a half hour's hike and then a fall out of ten minutes. Around the turn and down the hill to the second little village is our home for a little while. We are near a creek. Pass it before we get into the town square, where there is a single well which constitutes the water supply for the town. Down another hill to the last house in town, where nobody lives and nobody cares for the garden behind the house. Good bunks in 7 or 8 rooms, all light and airy, but dirty. Put my stuff down to claim a bunk and out on the grass to lie down for a nap, which I want more than anything else. The flies and bees, which are most numerous, annoy me, but I manage to get a little rest. There is a swift, babbling brook down an embankment, which furnishes power to the paper factory just above us. It is good to bathe in. I get a towel and clean socks. Bathe my body and feet, which is most refreshing. Unroll my pack and hang up my things on nails which are plentiful. Doolan goes scouting for supper rations, comes back with some things he needs and gets potatoes direct from the garden. I write until supper time. We have corned beef hash, new potatoes, coffee. Write again until time to light candles, when the boys come in to sit around the table which we have in the room. It is fairly cozy and a pleasant place to chat. This is the first time American troops have been in the town. The French were the former occupants. They have built themselves good bunks and have tables and other comforts. Eggs and wine are cheap as a result of no Americans having been here. The inhabitants are not aware of the wealth of our soldiers. The people are very hospitable and give us anything we want, gladly. The children get us wine or fruit in return for the hard tack which they consider a delicacy. There is a big aerodrome at St Cyr about half- way distant between Paris and this place and all day long the machines are up, most of them flying very low. From the distance can be heard the dull boom of cannon, very much modified by distance. Most of the boys cannot hear it. We are ordered to wear gas masks, helmets, belts, full ammunition and rifles or revolvers, a ridiculous order, which everybody 269up to the Major rebels against, because the Frenchmen and Americans of other divisions go about without any arms, or even masks. We are so far behind the lines that there is not the slightest reason for issuing an order like this, except as a disciplinary measure. The officers are doing their best to have the orders rescinded on condition that the men comply with the ruling strictly. For the sake of novelty, I take my breaches off, naked. Get a good night's rest. We have a lot to say before we fall asleep about the prospects of the war ending soon. A lot of faith put in the recent gains of the French and the Americans at Chateau Thierry. Caissons move. Even the English are getting into the spirit of Aliens and duplicating our victory. Fri. Aug. 9, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. Dress and go next door for breakfast. Bully beef, cold bacon, hard tack, coffee. Busy myself immediately with washing my undershirt, socks, handkerchiefs and the pair of breeches I got from Joe Kiernan. Look for a pot or something to boil them in. A youngster hoeing potatoes in a field helps me to locate a big kettle at a little cottage which is uninhabited but not abandoned. The people are visiting somewhere and what I take must be returned as soon as possible. Get water at the brook and use the kitchen fire to boil my things on. I notice all the men are cleaning their guns. I think they are doing it of their own accord for want of something better to do. Rub my clothes as well as I can without soap, seated on a bench in the kitchen, when Kapek tells me that I had better clean my gun, as there will be an inspection at 9:30. I think he is jesting and inquire of the Sergeant. Kapek is right. I leave my washing and go over my gun hurriedly. Lt. Griffiths will look us over with respect to the guns, masks, clothing and feet. Doherty again gets a call about E Co. men not having overcoats, as soon as the Lt. reviews the detachment, which the Sergeant has formed. He finds fault with many guns being polished well on the outside and showing lack of attention to the barrels. Next he goes over the matter of ammunition. It has become common knowledge that the men in their travels have thrown away cartridge clips to lighten their burdens. Some of our own men are notorious offenders in that respect, Farrell and Ernst particularly. They have none at all in their belts. The Lt. tells us it is a trick as old as cartridges themselves. Hereafter every man must be able to account for 100 rounds of ammunition in their belts or be charged with the cost of cartridges not accounted for. The Colonel is with us this morning and has issued strict orders to that effect, besides directing that only men with full belts are seen on the street. Doherty and a number of others with us are fooling themselves by having borrowed what ammunition they are short from men who are not standing inspection. I have the best record but one. My belt contains 90 rounds. Only 10 short. Deys, the only one who legitimately has 100 rounds. Ordinance is made for 1500 rounds for our small detachment. Next gas masks are inspected. The Lt. thinks mine is bad because it does not rattle. Told to see the Battalion Gas N Co. about it. Nothing gone over. Of course, my pants with two big holes in them come in for comment. The Lt. is satisfied with my explanation that I have a better pair in the wash. Feet inspected. My feet are in good condition. They feel good after yesterday's bath. The Lt. compliments us on having a fine lot of feet and tells us how to keep them in good condition. During that inspection I see the Gas Sgt. going along. I hail him and ask 270him about my mask. He tells me it should not rattle, contrary to what the Lt. says. Therefore my mask is OK. Tells me that we move again, time unknown, to the north, where a clean rifle is an asset. Suggest we put them in top shape. Dismissed for the day. Go back to my washing. I finish it as fast as I can, under the. circumstances. Spread my things on the grass to dry. Time for dinner now. Not much to anticipate. Bully beef, hash, hardtack, coffee. Lie down on another's blanket in the sun and toast myself for an hour. Hear the dull boom of war in the north. Does not disturb me in the least. It is a sound I am accustomed to. Aeroplane motors buzz overhead continuously but I pay no attention to them. Bothered by the flies and thoughts of home more than anything else. Too long ago since I have received mail from home and I have a guilty feeling for not having written to Leah and Mama for so long. My connection with home has been broken and I am miserably homesick and restless. I will try to write a letter to Leah now though for the life of me I do not know what to write. Go indoors where there are many flies. Put a handkerchief over my head and in that way get a little relief from them. Write indoors until it gets too hot. Go outdoors where it is too windy and too many spiders crawl about. Finish up inside where I began. Time for supper for which the boys have dug potatoes and picked stringbeans from the garden at our disposal. These are put into a stew with bully beef, which is by no means a success. The bully beef spoils whatever good there is in the vegetables. Also hardtack and coffee. We have had so much hardtack by now that the men throw it around, play ball with it and give it to the children. Feel as though I would like to take a look around the vicinity a bit. Shave and wash up, a refreshing feeling. Take a walk to the paper mill upstream, going without gas mask, or anything else. See some of E Company men in the field. The remainder of E Co. scouts come to visit, largely for the purpose of seeing how much money they can borrow for drinks. They are as anxious as I to go to ........ where the hospital is to look around, but do not know that men are now prohibited from going to town. Back in quarters to write until Lieutenant comes to tell us we must all carry 160 rounds of ammunition to-morrow, when we move, and must personally go to draw what we are short. After I have come back from my walk, the boys tell me that somebody has been looking for me in company with Allen, the runner who has directed him to where I am quartered. I cannot imagine who he is. From the description the men give me of him, the only person I can think of is Abe Gold, but that is rather improbable. After I come back from the supply company, where I draw the surplus ammunition, I meet Allen again. He tells me once more that the stranger was looking for me. He has left a note explaining his identity. His name is Greenfield and he is of the Attinson family of Staten Island. He has a note of introduction to me probably. I am too busy to look him up. Fill my belt with cartridges I am short and hook on to an extra bandolier of 60. Write again till it is too dark to see inside. Look for a candle but cannot find any. They are scarce as they are not issued with the field ration. Outside it is still light enough to write for a while, which I take advantage of for as long as possible. Orders come to stay near quarters to-morrow morning, as we may have to move at any moment. The welcome news is given us, though that we will have to hike to the railroad station only and from there will get transportation in motor lorries to our destination. That is too good to be true. The sergeant has a good idea of where we are going, from what the Lt. lets fall. We will go up as reserve to battalions ......., ...... and ......, behind the lines where the Americans are making such wonderful gains and taking so 271many prisoners. To-day's reports are very encouraging; many kilometers of country and thousands of men and guns are taken. I am not worried in the least at the prospect of going north where the fighting is so heavy. Resigned to what I must undergo from now on, taking consolation from the fact that as a scout, I will not be as much exposed to danger as I might be with a company in an engagement. The other men fortunately cannot go out to-night to get drunk to screw up their courage, as they have no money and can borrow none, so they sit outside on the embankment of the road and tell each other how many days they will be dead in a week from now, a custom which I frown upon. It is always the most popular topic of conversation, the day before a move of any magnitude is made. Not being able to borrow a candle, I go to bed, where I talk to Schlesinger who has been away from us all afternoon with Farrell and Ernst for the purpose of eating. This trio thinks of nothing else but their bellies and never come back without telling us how delicious such and such a viand was. Back of the hospital in ........ there is a row of graves of American lads who have died of wounds, except one who died of disease. A number of men busily engaged digging new graves all day long. In the evening, before dark, nurses and doctors from the hospital are in town for a stroll. They are chatting happily and enjoying themselves thoroughly, but I do not envy them at all. The doctors are kept busily saluting everybody in town.

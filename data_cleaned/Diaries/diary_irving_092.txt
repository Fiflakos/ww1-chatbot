Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 16 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. May 16, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Wash. Make up pack again. At formation names of men who go to school are read. Machine gun class. I expected to be called but an entirely new class is formed. Names of men, who ate iron rations given them for trip here, are taken. Reason advanced for this is that tinned beef was tainted. More fuss with inspection. Go to where we first drilled yesterday, where we spend an hour doing mostly nothing. Taken to number one field for practical demonstration of gas. Enter on field. Boys detect odor of pineapples. Some said apples. Then their eyes begin to smart painfully and soon we are all crying. We cannot see to dress in formation or stack arms. Gas masks kept slung when we remove packs. Put on to test out efficiency. Boys grumbling because it is so hot in there and inspection of masks is so slowly proceeding. Off to listen to a lecture on gasses employed by Fritz and how to detect them, by an English Corporal. Cut short after five minutes, which angers me. Always we are interrupted at an interesting lecture. Led off to center of field for some unknown purpose. Gathered in a circle waiting for something to happen. See gas bomb thrown directly at us. Shouts of "Gas". I hold my breath, take a look at it as it bursts, note sound and action. It sprays all around, causing fresh jets of flame as the air acts on it. Adjust mask in good shape, deliberately but quickly. Told to watch hair and clothes or they may be burnt. I had hopped out of the way of sparks while watching bomb fume. Men next to me are burned on legs after acid eats through leggings and trousers. Two men almost have their blouses burned off their backs. Others burned on hands. Quite a few accidents. Masks removed, formed columns of squares, given sq. right. I see Tommy bursting another bomb. Wait for cloud to come. Quick work getting into mask. Better work by all this time. Over. Company herded together. Gas in air and on ground is stirred up so that we cry again and cannot be formed into any kind of shape. Move like a mob to our packs. March off as another company waits to get their dose. Back to billets. Capt. waylays me. Fall out of column. Tells me I am to go to SOS school. To put away my equipment and report at once. Have a bit of tack. Go to the orderly room. None but clerk about. He has no orders for me. Wait. Read Leah's letter of the third over again. Hang around, wishing I had materials for writing a letter with me. Capt. and 1st Sgt. come, find a job for me with another man to police near storerooms. I manage to get two big hunks of cheese to break the monotony of job. Other fellow does most of the work until mess. Beef stew, bread and coffee. CO happens along. Tells me to report to Company clerk at 1:30. Outside until scolded by Sgt. for not getting up. Assigned to school with 5 men from this company. March to Hdqrs. to meet men from other Cos. Taken by Lt. to a field where we get our first lesson in looking through a telescope, compass, binoculars, how to use and care for them. No labour at all. A good school. Lie in grass. Ask questions of our Lt. who has come up to take charge. I want to make an impression. I like this work. Dismissed at 4. Back under our Corporal. Rest till retreat. Supper. Cheese, jam, coffee. Ask Reilly to accompany me to ........ immediately after supper. He consents. Dry mess tins. Start at 6:10, hat in hand. Walk down the road at a slow pace to keep cool. Talk of poverty of France and opulence of US. Watch planes and observation balloons. Comment on landscapes of countryside as we pass them. Go to the bath house, turn to the left and walk for an hour and 1/4 along a hard macadam road, till I find myself very tired. Meet many officers on road including our Brig. Gen. whom I salute with my hat off. Just before getting to town, we fall in with some friends of Reilly. Beg a match. They are very scarce. A big town. Everything to be had. Railroad station at which a company of Tommies comes in fully equipped to be billeted. Go to canteen. Disappointed to find I cannot get money order. A store Tommy breaks the news to me. Tells me to try civilian post office. I find it closed at 7. Determined to get one. Find Reilly, who has gone for a glass of stout. Find a Tommy there who knows where the field PO is. He gulps down his stout to direct me and swears at me when I say "thank you". He must have expected a tip. Postmaster is not doing business. Does not give MOs for states. Civilian Post Office only, or perhaps town Mayor. Have a drink with Reilly. Beer. Two of our men, anxious to go, give us half a bottle of wine. Leave. Go to town Mayor. Not in and does not deal in Money Orders. Try to buy matches. None in town. Buy chocolate. See jewelry stores which I would like to visit. Toys and souvenirs I would like to send to Leah and Cecilie. Pretty girls, grisettes. Out of town, meet Canadians to ask direction. we are undecided at crossroads. Take their advice. It proves to be wrong. Cut across fields of growing crops to right road. Meet Harry Schneider. Talk of last summer at Edgemere and boys. Home at 10. Sleep well. Very tired. Get a blank check from Harry, which may help me out of my difficulty. Tell Reilly my troubles in the course of my fight for exemption. No action of any kind at the front, that can be heard by us. A letter from Leah written on the 6th, transferred to the company from Camp. I am sorry that I have started drinking again while away from her.

Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 29th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 29th. Wednesday.I learnt this morning first by the congratulationsof the fellows and then by enquiring at the orderly room thatmy commission has gone through and dates from November 25th.But why I have not been called upon to go with the battalionrather worries me very much but then it is their own lookoutand I expect they will know better than to give me work to dothat I don't understand. I hope, however, that the delaymeans going to a school which is almost more than I can expect.Some fellows got three months schooling in England however!!I have not been away from the camp today. I went tohave a hot shower bath and had the fact brought once again before me that the military authorities, for installing such waterheaters, display deplorable weak knowledge. They are in noway satisfactory; they burn up quantities of coal in the fourfires and then the water is all at the one temperature and nocold water is obtainable to mix with it and to break it down,so much so that steam is often flying from the shower and themen have to stand back and wait until it is run off and coolsdown; there is no means of regulating the thing at all. Amost unsatisfactory and wasteful business and the British arestill erecting this type of concern.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 30 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. May 30, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Made a First Class Private. $3.60 increase in pay, taking effect as of May 28. Up at 6:00. Wash. Police. Air blankets. Breakfast. Bacon, coffee, bread. Nothing to do but sleep. I am pleased with last nights performance and would like more of it evidently. A shell in wood as near as night before. Shells aimed at road are not doing much execution. They make little report, landing in sand to south. Sleep till nine o'clock. Then sent with Black and 3 others to take bearings on five points from northwest of clump of woods. My morning's work consists of pacing off distance to two points. Miserably lazy. Lie down on the grass and ask the daisies a question which they answer to my satisfaction. The Company has come up to spend the day and night along their sector. Whole battalion out. All officers. They are having even less of a holiday than we. I feel sorry for them. On way a shell hits fifteen minutes before their arrival at a spot 50 yds. from them on road. Bring me news that I have been made First Class Private along with all the men in Scout School. Of my regular squad 5 have been promoted to 1st Class. Payroll will be signed here today. Cpls. Rist, Childs and Ostlieb in hospital. Cpl. Freese sick. Sgt. Kaplan missing three days now, overdue in returning from the front where he has gone to observe. The men are spreading a rumor that we will go with Pershing to Italy. They were very unwilling and mutinous on way here. Protest against little rest given them. Heavy packs tire them. All equipment with them, overcoats in pack too. No use hanging around company. We are not needed. Go back through path in woods. Meet Lt. and follow him for a while, but he sends us back, having nothing for us to do. Lie down on blankets outside of tent and fall asleep in hot sun thinking of past Decoration Days spent with Leah. Awakened by Mess Call. A bomb-shell in camp. Lt. Kidde brings a memorandum containing very bad news. School will be discontinued after tomorrow. We will go back to billets with Company. It will kill us to carry a pack after nine days rest. From happiness to gloom, a sudden transition. Appetite for a good dinner of stew, tack and coffee, lost. Nobody goes for seconds. Feed a few visitors instead. Our English porter not in sight. Telephone wires being strung across pasture north to south. No work. Lt. ascertains that we cannot get a regular bath, so we all get a bucket of water at farmhouse. Boys bathe in the open as well as possible under the circumstances. Scots manoeuvering to-day. All are jealous and express admiration for our tents. Go up to company to sign payroll. We find them digging a CT, sweating and swearing. We crow. Deem it wise not to stay after ascertaining that payroll has not yet been brought up. Lt. in charge of Company goes off into woods. We follow him and inquire when we may expect to sign roll. Tonight at 6:00. Back in tent. Write a ten page letter to Leah without interruption, except to look at skirmishes in air. Many observation balloons are up. Supper a howling success. More than we can eat. Using up surplus rations. Rice, two helpings, 3 if wanted, cheese, bread, dates, coffee. Englishman comes. Feed him too. He is saddened by news that we move. Go up to company again. Payroll not yet come. Meet boys. Talk to them. Tenting north of lines. Buy chocolate from them which has advanced in price from 1 Fr. in morning to 1 1/2 now. So we force up prices where ever we go. Excuse offered by canteens, we get good pay. Wait until eight. Decide to go back. Almost to entrance to pasture. Meet Corporal Haight on bicycle with payroll. Go back after directing him to Company Camp. He has been looking for us for an hour. See first fish life since I am in France in a pool by roadside. Frogs, tadpoles, minnows. Shells whistling overhead. Not causing much damage where they strike. Sign payroll as 1st Class Pvt. Back to camp. Write until too dark to see. Go to bed in comparative quiet. Air is deserted. Talk to Gillece for a long time until I remind him he must go on guard soon. Sleep well until 2. Awakened by Gillece to do guard duty until 4. Have a sandwich of cheese and bread left from supper. Ask if anything of importance has occurred. It has been very quiet. Day just breaking at 2:30. A signal for activity on part of Fritz. He sends five pills over to road. He is a most perseverent devil intent on hitting his objective. Rather difficult from distance estimated at 12 miles to strike such a small target. I lie in tent for half an hour before going on duty. Get some dates. Make a few rounds of post. Stir up campfire to get a coal to light my pipe with. Go back to tent. I hear a German airman over us. Wait for our guns to open fire on him. He is not discovered. I remain in tent until he drops three bombs to east of Farm House. Goes west and drops another somewhere near our Company Camp. Gets away without a shot being fired at him. Daylight now. Make a good fire. Wake Conway to relieve me. Finish my pipe. Go to sleep. Wade has been to town in forenoon to deliver mail. As he gets to road, a shell bursts near him. Throws up a column of earth, 25 feet into air. Spatters a nearby working party with mud. He falls off bicycle into wheat in field. Nothing done by way of damage. Wade none the worse for his experience. Says he laughed so hard at other men that he fell off cycle. We all dread tomorrow. In the early evening, I pick up another fragment from bomb dropped behind our camp. 10x3x1/2 inches. A cruel death-dealing missile. Days and boys milk cows in the pasture to obtain milk for our rice. A threatened thrashing from the farmer the result.

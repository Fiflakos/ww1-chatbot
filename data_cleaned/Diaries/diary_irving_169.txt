Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 2 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Aug. 2, 1918 Weather: Raining, Warm Health: Good Hike 30 Kilometers to ........ . From ........ to ........ the prettiest landscape in the valley that I have ever seen. The rainbow lends beauty to the mountain grandeur. Men glad to move off and go off singing, whistling and cheering, and end up, tired, footsore and grumbling. Lose my pipe, which I had in my layout. Men throw away new things regulations provide should be carried. "Lost in Action". Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. 254Wash. Police. Air blankets, look for cooties. Find three or four and a whole string of nits. Camp getting ready to move. F Co. rolls packs and has inspection like those we used to have at camp. I read my manuscript. Find nothing of interest in it. Put it away in a book. It begins to rain slightly. Watch F Company tricks, which I used to hate so much. They spread out all their equipment, which is examined by Lt. Keefer. Since early morning, something which sounds like a barrage is heard from behind us. I wash a towel, handkerchief and socks, taking a chance on them drying in time. At 9:30, Sgt. tells us we move in a body, going ahead of the battalion to pick out the road. The corporals from each company get a map, showing road, and as soon as we are ready, we can go. We must all meet at the YMCA in ........ . We decide to start before dinner to enable us to eat with E Company. We all roll our packs. It begins to rain and we cannot go. Police up, burn letters and papers making a bonfire in the barracks. Caution men against danger of dumping bullets into fire. Read until time for mess. I do not write because we may move at any minute. Dislike interruptions. Doherty gets rid of all his candy. Dinner. Boiled beef, sauce, squash, bread pudding, soup. Doubt whether we could have had as good a dinner with E. Still raining. About 2 it clears. Tallon tells us we do not go until the headquarters go, so I read instead of write again, thinking to do my writing after supper. Angry that I had to put writing into my pack. Corporal draws our supper rations, cans of salmon, some bread and crullers. The crullers are eaten at once. Gillece has come back from the company with our travel rations: sugar, coffee, 2 boxes of crackers for each man and a big can of bacon. None of us has the bacon or condiment cans, so we can only take the crackers with us. The bacon, sugar and coffee we ask the limber driver to put on his limber. Gillece has the trouble of bringing the big box of rations on his bicycle for nothing, as we probably will not see the bacon, sugar and coffee again. At 4:00, the Sgt. orders us to move. Black has gone ahead to help billet. He rides a bicycle, because he has sprained his ankle four days ago. I have left out a few things for packing at the last minute, which gives the men of my company an advantage over me. They get ready and before I know it are off before me. Angry at their brusqueness. Go off by myself. Do not notice that I am going by the long route. Change my course. Meet Sgt. and others. Fall in with them. We make excellent time to ........ without a stop to rest. There we wait for the entire scout detachment to come up, while we spend whatever money we have left and borrow money for cakes at the the Salvation Army Canteen. Give my last bit of change to Himpler and he brings back nothing for myself. Split up again by companies and hike to ........ . There we rest after an awful uphill climb to get wind for a still steeper climb, if we cannot get a lorry to ........ . None comes. E goes off first. I stay behind to roll a cigarette and go with F. All my legs can do to carry me up the hill. On top is a lorry which looks as though it starts soon. I ask one of the men if he goes our way. He says no. The driver comes and says yes. He will give us a lift too. Good luck. In a few minutes we start. On the road we pass E boys. The driver will not stop. Boys are angry. I feel sorry for them. At the YMCA in 10 minutes. We have lemonade there, crackers and cigars, while we wait for others to come up and have supper with us. I read and talk to the French people, who tell me of the time of the German occupation. In an hour E comes up, hot and mad. We eat. Salmon, bread, pork and beans. At 7, everybody is with us. Some of the men get a lift of about 2 miles. We were the only ones who rode all the way. A few of the boys go looking for beer and do not come back until we are ready to move on. It showers after 255which there is a wonderful rainbow, then a double bow. It moves across the sky not a mile away from us. Its base is in a field at the right and the foot of a mountain to our left. It still rains as we go off, leaving two men to wait for the battalion to come up, and guide them to the next crossing. We are walking into the rainbow. At ........ drop two more men. Take a short cut by a dirt road after crossing the Meurthe. For a time the right tail of the bow is only a few hundred yards from us. It is lost to view. Stops raining. Drop two more men. At each crossroad we get a rest in that manner. The next lap is a short one again. Then up into the mountains for a long gradual, uphill climb. Meet many companies of the 87th Division coming down. We kid them, telling them to turn back, the war is over, we are going home. They take it good-naturedly. We are traveling at a great rate of speed. Make at least 8 miles before we halt. Seems I was never in my life as weary. More men pass us. Another mile or more to a crossroad. Luckily we stop long to confer on which is the right road. We ask officers of an incoming battalion. They think the same as we, while Sgt. discusses and asks who wants to stay here. Black comes along on a bicycle in the dark. A great stroke of luck. He tells us we must go in the direction from which he came, which is at right angles to the road we were about to take. After Black rests, we start off again. Glad that I have not been left here. No shelter at all in sight. All downhill, so dark that a few times we are almost run down by automobile and cycles, which travel without lights. The maps we have are wrong according to the route Black takes. In ........, our next stop where two more men are dropped. The town smells fearfully of wet, soggy horse dung. From what the Sgt. says, the rest of us go on to the end of our journey. Another crossroad, which might not by any chance mislead the battalion, but the Sgt. insists that Ernst and I stay. They go on. We take off our packs and look around us for some place to get a little sleep. All the barns and houses are dark and the doors are locked. Climb into a wagon, a hay cart, and in ten minutes I am sick of the smell of manure, which judging by the odor is right under my nose. My back and sides are sore from the pack I have tried to sleep on. Cold all over. My teeth chatter from the chill. Ernst has left me and gone down below to look for Himpler and Quigly. I soon follow him. Ernst and I try again to get into a barn. We meet some men from the 145 MG. Ask them if they can shelter us for an hour or so. We go into a corral with them. At the entrance is a little cemetery where a few Germans are buried. It is very dark. Impossible to see the men I am with. Ernst has gone with someone else to a billet. I talk to two men about what they have to expect in the service in this sector. They tell me of air raids over town in which two or their men were killed. The people are inhospitable. They do not favor the Americans, seemingly pro-German. Soon time for the Battalion to come along, so I look for Ernst. Find him in a billet where there is a light and it is warm, talking to the corporal of the guard. I see a can of syrup and ask for some. Gladly given to me with some bread. Stay there for an hour, going to the door frequently to listen for the sound of marching men. At 2 I go out to the road again. Walk up and down between the two posts to keep warm. Lie down on my back on a board and manage to get a half hour's sleep, shivering from chill all the time. I am afraid I will catch a death of cold and fear for the other men, too. Still nothing is heard and no one from our organization is in sight. Think, now, that they have been lost by taking the wrong road at the point that puzzled us. Hearing noise down the road, I go in that direction to talk to the men and anger at my misfortune in being picked for such a job as this. I meet someone in the middle of the road and tell him 256what I think of the army. He looks at me. I look at him. It is D.... The battalion is behind him. Get my pack on as Lt. Griffiths comes up. I tell him I am nearly frozen, in a conversational way. He thinks I am complaining. Direct the battalion to the next crossroad. It is getting light. The column falls out to rest. Hear from the men what a hard hike they have had. Many men have fallen out of ranks. The ambulance picks up all there is room for, leaving the rest to shift for themselves. Everyone is fagged out. Sick men taken from the hospital to move with the company. They loiter with us and suffer greatly from heat and fatigue. Resume march with the scout detachment which leads the column. An observation balloon is up and we are in full view of it in the early morning light. Think it is our balloon so no attempt is made to hide. Fall out again for a rest and get in the rear of E, which billets with F in ........ . G and H go to ......... . Kiernan marching alongside of me, on a sore foot, just out of the hospital, limping. I prevail upon him to let me carry his belt, as I am fine after a half hour's rest. The town is seen through the trees, a kilometre away. The sight of the roofs and the kilometre stone heartens the men. A long time before everybody is billeted, after we get there. Men either go to sleep or bathe their feet as soon as their packs are off. The scouts are not billeted until last. In the meantime I go with Gillece to look for plums before we are assigned to a billet.

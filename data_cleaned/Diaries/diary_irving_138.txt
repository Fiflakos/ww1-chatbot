Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 2 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Jul. 2, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Wash and police or rather clean house. Breakfast. Bacon, hash, bread, coffee. My wash on line is still wet. Dishes must go unwashed, which is all I have to worry about this morning. When the working details are all out, I go upstairs to read and write. Lt. goes off alone, leaving orders for Gillece and me to go on post in the afternoon, after mess. Continue writing for more than an hour, when I have occasion to go outside. Hardly do I get under shelter in the latrine across the street, when a whizz, close by, bursts with a loud report, and the kitchen force and all those remaining behind, who were in quarters, make haste to find shelter in the dugout. When I arrive, there are our men and a half dozen signalmen and linemen there. They were taking down dead wire near OP and were apparently spotted by German observation 198balloon, which sent a recommendation that they be shelled. Hell, Jerry almost made a good job of it. Only one man was frightened, not hurt, but instead of running to assigned shelter, he goes elsewhere. Not two minutes later than the first, another arrives doing damage to the terrain, and sending in linemen from another job. With the third, I arrive in the dugout. I find a red, upholstered, velvet chair, tip it backward and take advantage of my enforced lay-off from writing by settling myself for a nap. More and more shells come over, the bursting and flying shrapnel finding many a target in the courtyard of the villa and on the roof. It must have been a respectable thud to he heard in the cellar as each flying piece hit the roof. An aero up to watch fire effectiveness. He is shelled by us, so close to our town, that the shrapnel falls into the street, through the trees and in the garden. A shower of missiles for a time. Linemen tell of previous similar experiences. After half an hour, I fall asleep in the chair and do not wake until it is all over. One or two men are still there, but I doubt if I would have been awakened by them had they gone away, which they were on the verge of doing. In that case had a gas shell come across, I would have been in trouble. Upstairs to write again until noon mess. Roast beef, meat balls, bread, coffee. So very good that I ask for more. Get a pistol, issued with clips of ammunition. Now I want for nothing more in the way of arms. Guns, pistol, etc. hooked up and Gillece and I go off to war again, together with Sgt. Kirshner. To a boyau and along more than a mile of winding trenches, narrow, with shored up sides and a boardwalk floor. It is hot, helmet is heavy, no room for comfort, too narrow in some places to pass, without going through sideways. Perfectly hidden from view by Fritz. Sweat is pouring down my face and into my eyes, so that they burn, until I can no longer see. A never ending walk, which might just as well have been accomplished by going over the hills and through wood. Lt. Cook not at Hdqrs. when we arrive. Del Duca is telling the men how he did it last night. He was over the top to look for Huns and ran into three of them, who ran back, leaving a bag of grenades behind. Cpl. Wall also has had a brush with the Huns. E Company had quite a bit of excitement last night on the whole. Many of the men had their ambition to take a shot at Jerry satisfied. One casualty. Weaving is shot in the head. Not seriously injured, Taken to base hospital. Del is worshipped by the boys and officers. Capt. is all smiles. Del is glad to see me. I listen to him. Anxious to get a drink of water. None about. Do without. Observation post is only a short distance to the right. All fallen trees and a tangle behind camouflage screen, into a Ct. and we are there at first bay of line. Evidently an old bombing post. Little protection against observer being observed, and as far as I can see no view of enemy lines at all. We look right down into our own, where men go about unconcerned and exposed to view. I might as well get completely into open with my glasses. No view there either. Post cannot be improved upon for field of view. Sgt. climbs a tree, but neither can he find German lines. No use going back to quarters yet, so sit in the little shack after camouflaging door opening with a dead pine and installing an old stove for a chair. Look and look, but can see nothing. Sgt. and Gillece go further on to scout for a better position, leaving me alone, where I am in danger of being picked off by a sniper, if I become too observant. For a half hour or so I observe, and seeing nothing I rest sitting on the first of two steps, where I fall asleep for a while. Awakened when pipe falls out of my mouth. Take another look, just as unsuccessfully as before. I have had enough of that. Sgt. and Gillece come back. We all go up to Lt. Cook's quarters once more and sling the bull. Lt. McDougall, Sgt., Gillece and I go 199over map, look wise and ask each other what we think his next move will be. An exciting sport. I guess and take a chance stab at locating points and Fritz' motives in attack, which is taken as seriously by Lt., as though I were a General. We kid him along for a half hour. Sgt. Kirchner goes back to quarters and we go for another futile hour's observation at the post. Nothing to report. Lt. Cook is in command, this time, when we are on safe side of screen. He looks and acts like Robin Hood and his robber gang in the woods. He and McDougall take the map and register "deep thought" stuff in order to make up a list for to- night's patrol and their place of action. We are not consulted by the doughty Lt. for which I am glad, since I am a better man with a pick and shovel than I am a scout and I know nothing about the sector. Some men from the Company must go on a gas guard in the city tonight. They are taken away from a comfortable rest, told to roll their packs and follow us, who are ready to go in. The same long tiring walk through the trenches, though this time not so warm a job, the sun being low. Meet Thurn in the town. He has been out all day and is bringing back a story of how a Colonel questioned him and found him a very intelligent young man, asking his name, in a tone which implied that promotion will be certain in the near future. Back to town for supper of salmon, rice, syrup, bread, coffee. Rest a bit and begin a letter to Leah in return for two which I have received from her in the morning. They are of the fifteen that are missing and answer all the questions that I am in doubt about. She has had two letters from me, written at ......... . In one of hers is enclosed a postal from Mr. Modole, who inquires of her about me. It is a touching reminder of regard in which he holds me. I am sorry I have forgotten him. I write until it is dark and then by candlelight with blinds drawn. Lt. and Sgt. go out on a job, taking with them 7 men, probably to stay out late. Does he purposely avoid calling on me, when the work entails danger? It seems he does. I am thoughtful. I do not want him to do that. I go to bed at 10., making myself as comfortable as possible by removing shoes and stockings and gas mask. Talk for a half hour with Maloy, across the room, about Staten Island. Gillece talks in his sleep. Windows are open and it is comfortable. Sleep well.

Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 18th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 18th. Saturday.I slept in a canvas shake-down last night under theshafts of a waggon. I thought I heard rain falling in theearly morning.The previous night it was anti-aircraft guns and airbombs falling that woke me up. This time it was a kind ofmysterious patter on the canvas, not rain quite but what elsecould it be? When Winzar got out at 7.30 I found it was snowthat caused me to think during the darkness. Anyhow, thinksI, snow and frost is, at any rate, better than rain and mud.But alas, before 10 a.m. it commenced to rain and has beenraining on and off until now, 8 o'clock. This makes me swearas I fear for wet feet, I will be getting lumbago again.I half expected the 1st Battalion to send for metoday, not that I am over anxious or fretting in the slightestabout my new position. It will all work out well I am quitecertain. Some of the fellows say I'm a damn fool and all therest of it, as we all know how officers are cut up, but thisI cant help. I've been called upon and willingly I go.Never mind the outcome, if its only a wound I will get the best - 17 -possible treatment. Oh, but it is nonsense to talk aboutgetting hit etc. As I have often said, "If there's a bulletor a shell with my name and address on it, its no use dodgingit"I have packed my kit up and although I have noclothes or anything else much, I am ready to move into thenew position.

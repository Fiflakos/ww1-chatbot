Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 21 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. Jun. 21, 1918 Weather: Raining, Warm Health: Good Up at 11. A fine state of affairs in the army. Again it is mess kits that take the place of a bugle. I dress quickly and run out for a breakfast of beans and coffee. I am too late to get anything but coffee. Gratifyingly hot. I get back to bunk and get everything full of mud in doing so, blankets and clothing. It steps raining and looks clear long enough to give me reason to believe it is good opportunity to wash clothes. I have taken a run around town to dodge detail duty and to buy cake and nuts to supplement my poor breakfast. Store like New York. Good stock and good service. Through town in a few minutes. Streets named for big cities on continent. See a factory block and ....... where Americans are quartered. A mill wheel turned by first dirty stream I have seen in these parts. Walk up road coming upon a Frenchman on guard at an ammunition store in a dugout. Stop to pass the time of day and obtain a light for my pipe. A fat Frenchman comes along. He eyes me suspiciously and questions soldier who gives a good account of me. Then he questions me. He can speak English well. I look him straight in the eye telling him I am only out for a stroll, having stopped to look at something which interested me. He goes away and I return to billets shortly afterwards. An ammunition train pulling up to the line. Little donkey carts. Regulars. Still clear. I undress in my bunk, taking only suit of underwear and towel to street trough. Women object, laying claim to piece of board I pick for my own use. I give them preference, shaving and washing, while I wait for them to finish, borrow their brush and do my work. Three or four showers come up in the meantime. Tallon gives me a letter from Sam Friedman. Hang clothes on a barbed wire fence to dry. Read newspaper. Go outside to take advantage of sun, dodge detail and to write a letter to Leah, describing my night marches. Company goes on guard. Men posted on street corners to look for aeroplanes and give alarm in case of gas attack. A siren in square for that purpose. Two companies go into the line tonight. Undecided which is to go. It rains intermittently all afternoon. Mess of boiled beef, bread, potatoes and coffee at 4:00. Make up for scantiness of morning meal. Write again until ordered to roll packs. Countermanded by Corporal. I must mount guard between 12:00 and 2. I am to transfer my things to opposite barracks, where rest of guard is quartered. I will not do this until I have finished my letter. To be ready in case we move. I put on my underwear, while it is still wet. OD shirt instead of undershirt, which is too wet. Aeroplane alert sounds. Tin hats are put on and everybody is ordered inside, so that pictures cannot be taken of us in numbers. Mess served in squads with same purpose in view at 4. I continue writing indoors. Other men crowd in doorway, in spite of orders, to watch shells bursting in air sent up by our men to bring down Fritz. Lasts for an hour. Outside to finish letter. Dark now, Corporal orders me to claim a bunk. I do so. Transfer my stuff and my handful of straw. Take a lower bunk and go outside to find some long grass for bedding. None in the vicinity. Go back. Cannot bear to think of sleeping on wire again this night, so I make a determined effort to get something other than hay or grass, going down the road for this purpose. Find a few handfuls of grass. Meet a man with a knife who has been cutting twigs. Good idea. Ask him to lend me his tool. He is very obliging. We chat while I get twigs enough for my bed. Tells he he thinks I am above the average for a soldier and he would like to make a friend of me. His name is Boone, G Co. I promise to look him up, when I have time. Make up my bunk. Eifert, who is next to me, refuses my offer to team up, so I sleep alone. In a few minutes Corporal tells me post I was to guard has been abolished. Thankful. I cannot sleep, owing to a high temperature. I toss and cannot shut my eyes. I do not know that I have a cold or any other disorder. At loss to know what ails me. I am worried. Think that I have contracted some contagious disease from a sweater that I found and have worn for last few days. Other queer ideas. Boys are all awake and are making a terrible din. Corporals swearing at each other and noise prolonged by men who wish to sleep, swearing end shouting at non-coms for making noise. They are having a feast of some kind over which there is a great deal of contention. Bread and meat evidently stolen from kitchen. A case of one thief calling another. When men are told to unroll packs, there is much grumbling. That job has become so distasteful that men would prefer going to the front. It is so to-night. A number of aeroplane engagements during night. No shelling noted. We are so situated that it is difficult to find us. In a small valley. Pine and birch forests all around us. Gardens are kept by all householders. None show signs of care and cultivation. Strawberries, cherries, plums and other fruits plentiful in this vicinity. Some of our boys have gone out and return with handfuls of berries. When order to roll packs came, I was greatly disturbed, owing to proximity of 27th. Much relieved that other companies go into the line ahead of us. They will probably stay 6 or 7 days before we are due to relieve them. I pray that this is so. If only I am not in action on the 27th. I will not complain if I am called upon the very next day. I can go on with my work thinking that God has been good to me, giving me a year of happily married life for which I will thank him from the depths of my heart and worship with my whole soul. I would like to receive a telegram or other evidence of remembrance from Leah on that day. French newsman creates a laugh. He comes in blowing a horn. Reminds boys of a fish.

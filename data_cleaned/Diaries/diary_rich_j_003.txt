Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 5 October 1914. Nationality: Australian. Monday Oct 5thThey smother up the roll call inmy favour yesterday, and instead oftrouble to. day, I am clear & free.It was, however, a big risk.We all marched in good order forabout 8 miles out around Marowbraarriving back to camp at 5.35.The back section of the 3 had a lot oftrouble in picking up the correct step, dueconsiderable to the fact that our officers aresuch bad, short stepped and ramblingmarchers. But the average soldieras far as my experience goes with theA.M.C., is a arrargent conceited andboastful person, "superb grand standplayers." Alway judging their standardof manhood by the worst man in thesquad. The Englishmen mostly area loud voiced, empty inconsiderate lotand can be easily picked out by their stiffand bound up movements. No leaveto night but I went & had tea with CisSponza.

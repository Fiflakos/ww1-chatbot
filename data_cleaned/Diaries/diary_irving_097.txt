May 21, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Greeted by a birdie who sings "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy" as I step out of the barn door to go to breakfast. Up at 6:00. Do not appear at Reveille. Breakfast. Rice, Bread, coffee. Hoping we do not have to appear at drill formation. We were not given any instructions for today when we were dismissed last night. I stick my head out of alleyway behind billet to see if men are assembling. Find 2 Companies' representatives already there. Prepare to go out. Rest of our men come up. Lt. inquires who can ride a horse. Picks Himpler from among volunteers. 2nd Lt. leads us off to where we patrolled last night. Has men who were out go over same ground again in same manner for purpose of discovering and correcting tactical errors if any. Black's patrol criticized for appearing on sky line in our movement. Lt. seems to be at a loss about what he shall give us next. Marches us up embankment, has us do close order drill, a procedure which arouses men to make audible complaints. Feel like a high school boy who is asked to spell cat. Gas mask drill. Awfully hot in respirators. One complaint made. Overheard by Lieut. who resents it very much. Man thinks we are being drilled too hard and to no purpose after the little sleep we had. He is given the option of discontinuing with the class. He stays. Zimmerman, amateur champ boxer from Ga., new man in place of Broadhead. He gets into trouble because he cannot take work seriously. Glad when gas mask is put away. Go through field of tall clover, in which our shoes and leggings get very wet, to our classroom in the woods. We are all very tired, which by now is so evident that Lt. permits us to fall out for nearly an hour. I take a nap. He then gives us an exercise in patrolling, which we decide to take advantage of by loafing. I believe Lt. is aware of our decision too, giving us this work more to get us out of the way than for any other reason. Zimmerman's smile causes his dismissal. Lt. threatens to make a report on his misconduct. We are sent into the woods where we lie down into a little group shortly after our arrival. Lieut. seen approaching by our lookout, we separate and hide in twos until time to return. Officer comes up just as corporal is making up his report and sketching map. We all lie like the devil about what we have been doing. Get a rest from our arduous labors when we come back. Spend a half hour designating and shooting at targets on road from concealed positions. Back for Mess. Boiled beef, rice, coffee, vegetables. No bread or hardtack. Sleep for three quarters of an hour. Out without blouses. To English musketry range for practice with our rifles. Lie in a peculiar position. Our heads are pointed downhill. Too much strain on left elbow. Piece wobbles. Our work is dismal failure. Annoys young English Lieut. Up slope to take a lesson from Sgt. in Tommy's method of quick loading and firing. He has had four yrs. of it. Too much. A crack shot. A company of Scots going to hike. Back into billets. Boys have been paid. I go for mine. Get 61 Frs. Collect some debts owing me. Mess. Cheese, bully, jam, coffee, bread. I go to clover field where we were in forenoon to find some forget-me- nots which I want to enclose in my letter to Leah. I hurry back to be in time for show which we are giving tonight on Gas field. I prepare to shave. My name is called, wanted by Company Clerk. Slip on a blouse. Wanted at Batt. Hdqrs. Report to Sgt. Major who wants instructions about additional work to be done on payrolls. It is now too late to go to show. Write. Get a bucket of water. On way, see Reilly being carried in roaring drunk, by two men. Many others in same condition. Brawls at every estaminet. Five or six men in my platoon are the worse for wear. Reilly is laid on grass. I shave, bathe my upper body, feet. Make bed. Undress Reilly after he has been carried to bed. Sit outside for a last smoke until it is dark. Helpless men are brought in. Go to bed. Reilly and the rest are all puking. My blankets are all full of puke. Clothes too. Rowdyism. Pulling of blankets begins. Smell too much also. I go outside on field with our blankets. Two Tommies come to warn us not to show lights. They expect Fritz tonight. Lie down in overcoat, blouse, one blanket to cover. Cold. Lt. comes at 11 to stop noise. At 12:30 Fritz comes. Antis and machine guns drive him off. An exciting battle. I see and hear well through entirety, bursting shells, searchlights, roads alive with men going to points of vantage. Quiet at 2:00. Driven in by cold at daybreak. Little artillery action. Much in air. A company of Scots pass through, back from Palestine.

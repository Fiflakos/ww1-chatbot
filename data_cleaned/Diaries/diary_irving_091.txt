Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. May 15, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Find a stranger at my feet. Tommy has come in during the night drunk, and lay down in the first convenient spot in all his clothes. I cannot find one of my leggings. Must wake him up in my search for it. I find an odd one under him. Put it on without further search so as not to be late for formation. We must all fall in for Reveille from now on, taking with us our mess kits. Captain commanding company. Breakfast. Bacon bread, coffee. Bread ration is sufficient. Will drill with short pack containing one blanket and poles only. Not very much time in which to roll them. Formation at 7:15. A lengthy morning inspection similar to English style. Men criticized severely in all platoons. Officers insist on men shaving more frequently. Start out for drill. Major picks out a site for us on a road. Lieut. Jepsen not in good humour. Capt. leaves for a while during which we get some brand new stunts from Lieut. He is a stickler for manual, which he can do very well. Gives us a new brand of physical exercise with a rifle. Lieut. with us in so far as rests are concerned. It is very hot in the sun, a distinct difference between local climate and that of last place. Blue skies and beautiful landscapes. Men and women at work in the fields, birds singing everywhere, airplanes flying overhead. Company assembled at 10. We go back to respective billets, remove packs, fall out again looking as neat as possible under the circumstances. Led off by Captain to a large field to the west of town where we are drilled in close order in Company and platoons to prepare ourselves for inspection by British Brigadier General. Our own General appears on the scene. Seems to have been observing us and comes up to Captain to compliment him on our work. There is a look of the greatest pleasure on the face of the CO. English at ease is discarded from today. Rest a few minutes before Englishman arrives with our Major who orders open ranks and an inspection is given us. Brig., Gen., Major, Adj., and Captain walk along, look intently into each man's eyes. I notice Gen. hesitates, for a moment, as he passes me, while I am gazing steadily at neck of man in front. When his trip is finished he asks that we do a bit of manual for him. Capt. puts lots of pep into it, then platoon leaders put us through a few capers to please authority who pays little attention to us. They examine Sgt.s equipment. A fervent prayer is said by us that his mess kit be found with a week's collection of grease on it etc. When he is satisfied that we have drilled before this, we gather around him forming three sides of a square. Major tells us that Gen. has something to say to us. In substance he says that he is glad to see us here. Then he tells us that he has discovered what he was looking for when he looked at each of us in passing. He has discovered we are all dreadfully keen to get into the game. He knows we are going to punch it. His speech is one that does credit to a schoolboy. He rides away in state, leaving the fate of France and England in our hands. A hundred scout planes are up during the ceremony. Three observation balloons, a new sight to us, are up in the distance. We are dismissed for the morning after being led back by Lieut. On the way back we are reprimanded for singing a proscribed song. Have mess. Stew, bread, coffee. Have a half hour in which to rest. Ordered to form armed with towel and clean clothing to be in readiness for a bath. Hike about two miles to next village. Arrive at bath house wet from perspiration. Must wait for time. Lie around, read newspaper, take a little nap. Admitted to bathhouse in groups of twelve. Undress standing on a muddy floor. Into adjoining chamber, which has 6 small shower heads, size of 25 cent piece, each having exactly nine holes, under which two men must bathe in 4 minutes. It seems impossible to accomplish but the miracle is worked somehow and quite a satisfactory bath was obtained. Dress and wait outside feeling refreshed. It occurs to me to ask an Englishman where I can buy a money order. He directs me to ......... , where there is a canteen and post office. Too far away to go tonight. Company goes back by platoons at a slower, cooler pace. Observation balloons still up. Rest, write, Mess when entire company is back. Cheese, bread, coffee, rice. Find a spot in a nearby field where I sit under a tree and write until dark. Take a hurried shave. Go out for a little stroll after I make my bed. Around the corner two Canadians who have had long experience at the front are telling stories to a group of our men. Plausible ones, full of cheer. A beautiful night, sky full of stars and a fine moon. An airplane is heard overhead in the semi-darkness. We make an effort to find same. Look for a long time until we see a light which travels overhead in direction from which sound is coming. A most interesting half hour spent watching it. Go to bed long after bunkmate. Awaken him. Corporals come in engaged in a heated discussion which awakens everybody. A Boche machine gun is heard overhead, followed by sound of shells bursting in air and the hum of our own machines going for it. All get up, crowd in doorway to look. See nothing. Quiet. Repetition of incident. Madame out and watching this time, talking excitedly. Searchlights play and bombs burst in air. Astir for a long time hoping to see and hear more. Artillery quiet. No activity of any kind today, Practice firing within our own areas.

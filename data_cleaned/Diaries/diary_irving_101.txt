Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 25 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. May 25, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Too late to go to farm house to wash. Use my canteen for washing and shaving. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Clean gun, anticipating inspection. Lt. divides us into two parties, one to dig and construct an observation post in woods, a wonderfully sheltered spot. Chinese about, cooking dinner. Boys parley with them. English are not very well liked. I go out over trench system again with Lts. We find many more miles of ditch, some uncharted. Must study all over again. New points of strategic importance. Puzzling in the extreme. Even Lts. staggered at times. Go over roads, through woods. Follow offshoots and CTs to get better idea of system. Use glasses at odd moments. From distance attempt to pick out our Post. Impossible. Can see no movement whatever at point approximately near our Post. Train glasses on object in different direction. Pick up something that appears to be a post of some kind. Make everybody curious to see my discovery. Many things suggested. We push forward later in its direction and find object to be latrine in woods at far end of our sector. Bombs burst not far from us. Lt. notices English walking about in camp and roads wearing gas masks. It occurs to him to try it on us. Line up to put on and adjust. Start across trenches and field, over wire and bridges with gingerly steps. Can breathe fairly well in mine, but rubber binds so that my entire head hurts. I doubt if it is possible to wear for an hour at a time. A great relief for all of us when we are ordered to remove mask. Bathed in sweat and a welt on face where mask was. Pick up party in woods at work on observation post. Take tools with us. It looks like a half holiday. Dinner on arrival. Cooks best efforts expended on it. Steak, mashed creamed potatoes, onions, bread, coffee. Rest until 2:00. Write. Intend to go to show. Lt announces names of men who will be permitted to go to Company Headquarters. Must not stay in or go to any other town. Forbidden, unless pass is obtained from Major. They will bring back mail and take letters for posting. I offer to buy a bottle of wine if eight letters are brought back for me. Since I have received mail on Tuesday, I do not expect any. Thought I was making a safe offer. Write until it is too late to go to matinee. Take a nap until supper time. I bag (big?) mess after I go for water to bathe and boil clothes in. On way I meet two company men who are quartered near farmhouse. They come back with me to visit. They are envious of us for being so well fed. Cheese, jam, bread, coffee. So much that I cannot eat it all. Finish changing clothing, put old clothing to soak and boil. Our English friend has been hanging about all day. His actions are very suspicious. Almost ready to start for evening show when Lt. suggests we try out our snipers rifles. Clean bores and set up small targets in range. Dandy guns. All five pepper target. Most of men do well. More difficult targets to hit are suggested. A cartridge case upended in sand embankment. Difficult to see, same color as earth. A piece of white put behind it. One man wastes five shots on it. Lt. takes four. I put a hole in it first try. Later other men make it three times out of five. Grows too dark for further shooting. Clean bores and put away guns. Suggest that we go to crest of the hill to watch big guns spit fire. A terrible bombardment has commenced. Far greater than any I have yet heard. A combat in the air. Locate source of firing by puff of smoke and flash of flame. Stay for a few minutes. Go back. Find boys have returned from town. Eleven letters for me. I must buy wine. Too late tonight but tomorrow will do. Set to reading them at once. I strain my eyes in the darkness. 8:30 before I give up my pleasant task. Eat a sandwich of cheese and bread left from supper. Disappointed that men have brought no chocolate with them. Remain awake. It is our tent's turn to do guard duty. I am first shift. No one goes to bed until late. Want to observe and listen to battle and noise prevents sleeping if they are so inclined. Lights are lit in two tents, which I must order put out. Lieut. gives orders for tomorrow. Colonel and Major expected to visit us. Will look over ground. On guard, I pace up and down a few times, then sit down on bench. It is a dark night. Hell is let loose. Flashes of light from cannon and rockets appear in bold relief against sky. It is a misty cold wind that blows. I am a bit nervous. Would very much like someone to talk to. Tired, too. Very watchful though danger a minimum probability. Firing is all from us, judging by the sound. Pass my post every fifteen minutes. Would like a bite to eat. KP gets up. I ask for bread. He tells me where to look. I find some marmalade, too, making noise getting to it. Wake Gillece at 11:55 to relieve me. Tell him of storehouse and turn in. I cannot sleep. Not on account of nerves or thoughts. It is the noise that disturbs me. It keeps up unabated all through night, A visit from Fritz at 4:00 AM.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 3 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Aug. 3, 1918 Weather: Clear, Warm, Rains at night Health: Good Hike 22 Kilometers to ........ There is no fruit to be had. Many plums but none are ripe. The fields are yellow with ripe grain, or grain cut and stacked decorates them. Here or there an isolated grave of either a Frenchman or Boche interred where he fell. There is one in a garden where truck grows all around it. Behind the church I get some currants and peas in the pod, after which I get my pack from against the church wall, where I have left it, and look for my billet. The Lieut. directs me to No. 30, which is a huge barn where fresh hay and chaff is stacked high. The new mown hay is spread generously on the floor, where the men who came on without stopping are all asleep. There is room between two of them for me to lie down without removing anything, but my leggings, to permit of a free circulation of blood in my legs. Clothes wet from perspiration, but that does not keep me from sleeping soundly until 12, when I am awakened to get my mess. Kitchen as usual is at the end of town, which proves to be a very small one, very poor and ramshackle, full of foul smelling manure piles and incredibly filthy. Little damage, comparatively, from shells and bombs. Look again for fruit but find none. Dinner. Cold, burned roast beef, evaporated potatoes, syrup, bread, coffee, as much as one wants of it. A lot left over given to the Frenchmen and children, who greedily take what is given. Get back to billets, where there is a lot to do. I must open my pack to-day to dry the wet things I have in it. There is a very hot sun shining! Wash my OD shirt, handkerchiefs, socks. They all dry in a short time. Wash my feet, shave and look for cooties and am glad to find none. The Captain and Major have put into effect an order that men must wear leggings and blouses. This, to my mind is ridiculous. After a man has made such a stiff hike as last night, and is completely knocked out, he should be permitted a little latitude in the matter of dress. I am seen by the Captain without my leggings and in my undershirt, but he says nothing. Maloy goes 20 feet from the billets and is scolded by him. As late as 4 o'clock in the 257afternoon men who were left on the road last night, still come in. The infirmary which is directly underneath us is crowded to capacity all day. There is nothing but beer to be had in the town. Men are all broke anyhow and it is the rule to be going around trying to borrow. Goldsoll went to look for a room and bed when he came in and unfortunately he hires one which has been assigned to the Captain. As a result he is guarding the town all by himself. Before supper, I make my pack and get ready to move at a moment's notice. I have been carrying an extra pair of shoes, very much worn, only so that I could take ink with me. To-night I find a new place for the ink, in my gas mask, so I lose the shoes. Corp. Thurn and the Lt. have gone over the route of to- night's march on bicycles and have returned. It is so free from misleading crossroads that it is not necessary for the 305th to go ahead and act as guides. We will march with the column behind Hdqrs, which is leading. Write until supper time. Arrive a little ahead of time, but the scouts manage to persuade the cooks to feed us early. Beans, hard tack, meat tinned, coffee. I get little peppers, too. Orders are to move at 8:15. I write until it is time. The boys give their little entertainment of songs composed by Black. Everybody is chipper. We fall in and march to a point on the road where we can take the lead when the companies come up. Black entertains again. The YMCA man and the Major amused. The pack is very light. Hike uphill to begin, which warms us up thoroughly. See a herd of about 200 cattle, the only big herd I have seen. After the first hill, it is mostly good hard road. Hike 50 minutes. Fall out where we can look down into the valley and enjoy the scene, three villages nestling in the valley, golden fields, orchards and a setting sun. In the distance over the top of the crest, a flash can be seen occasionally. We all wonder at the vividness of it and it does not enter our minds that it is lightning. Everybody decides it is the flash of a gun, but question why we hear no report. It is clouding up from the north. It grows very dark and going through ........, where there is a bridge, the rear of our column lags behind. We must cut down on the pace ahead. Thundering now. At our second fall out the men get out their slickers. It lightens from all sides. Begins to rain. Stops as we march again. I would rather get wet than wear my slicker, which is handy on top of my pack, nevertheless. What looks like buildings in the dark proves to be trees. Now we run into another shower. It thunders, lightens and blows a gale. Beginning with a light rainfall. It grows steadily heavier as we travel. There are lights to be seen in what looks like a barracks. We travel towards them. They are on both sides of the road. But for them and the flashlights, we would walk all over ourselves, it is so dark. As it is, we walk off the road on both sides. It is raining, so that my left side is as wet as if a bucket of water is being emptied slowly over me. It runs down my pack and into my breaches and leggings, and trickles into my shoes. My face is being washed. The horses go with difficulty. Think surely we will halt to take shelter where the lights show, but we pass them. Buildings are hospitals and QM stores. Men fall out. Two of our scouts leave the ranks to get under a shed and we do not see them any more that night. Everybody who has a flashlight is using it, which makes it imperative for safety's sake to order them put out. Only the officers using them. I find my cane a great aid in walking. I use it like a blind man, by tapping the road directly ahead of me. Keep calling Gillece to enable us to keep together. We are going fast in the face of difficulties. I lose my cane and put the entire detachment out until I find it. A flash of lightning, so vivid , that it blinds us. Looking down the road it looks as though we were walking into the tree tops. My clothes oozing water. After a while I find it useless to 258fret about it, for it cannot get any worse. We march on till we outwalk the shower. One good thing about it is that it has become cool. I am no longer perspiring. The stars come out and we see the lightning following the path of the storm cloud. Fall out for a rest against a tree which drips water. I am too wet to mind. Sitting in my helmet, because my bottom is naked! On our next march, the wind dries my clothes a little, aided by the heat from my body. My legs are stiff and my feet are sore on account of my leggings shrinking. Talking to Wolfe about printing helps me forget my discomfort and the time flies. We annoy the other fellows, because we talk shop. Grow chill and stiff in the next rest period, which is a long one to allow the companies behind us to catch up. We march again and, on the hike, we sing going through ........ . Cheer the runners, the Sergeant Major. Kastner and the runners cheer us according to the new formula. The roads are drying. It is delightfully cool for hiking. The stars give enough light to march by and at a good clip go through ........, singing and whistling. Plenty of manure piles in the long winding street and not a house touched by the Boche. At the last rest, the Major urges us to do our best, by telling us it is the last lap we have to go, which partially accounts for the fast pace. I am sure this town will be our stop for the night, thinking we go to the end of it, because it is so big, but we pass out and make two kilos more to ........ . Part of the road on this last stretch is dry, as it has not rained in this vicinity at all. This is remarked upon by the men. No sooner than said, when it clouds up over us and begins to rain as we enter the town, though to our right and left the stars show. Into the square where we are kept waiting in the rain while the billeting party is looked up. The Major goes through the town calling for McDougall, who has fallen asleep in his billet. When they are found, the rain stops. Gradually the men are assigned to billets. We are given a still bigger barn then yesterday, in which both runners and scouts are put away without being noticed. We are in trouble when we try to get in. The door is bolted and barred. It was not to be opened until 4:30. It is 3:25, so we break in. There is lots of new mown hay, straw and chaff for bedding. Before we can unroll our packs to get out candles, the men fall through holes in the floor. Bunk up with Himpler, fix my things in order and go downstairs for coffee, which the Lieutenant announces will be served at 4:00 o'clock at billet 21, which is at the other end of town. Ten minutes' walk from my quarters. It is growing light. Coming back with 3 cups of coffee (some for my comrades), the day breaks. Against a black velvet background is a lustrous silver moon, a crescent. Back in quarters, I open a box of crackers, part of iron ration, which it is forbidden to eat, and drink coffee which tastes like a drug. The crackers will go down in history as having been lost. Asleep at 4:30. First time my breeches have been off in a month of nights. Miss my tobacco pouch and feel its loss keenly, because it is a gift from Leah. It shows up miraculously before I go to bed. All night I have been asking men to roll cigarettes for me. Rather out of luck.

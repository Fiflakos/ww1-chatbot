Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 6 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon, May 6, 1918 Weather: Raining, Mild Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Go out for breakfast. Intercepted by Lieut., who tells me I am wanted at Battalion Hdqrs. to report at 6:30 to Sgt. Major. Probably wanted to work on payrolls. Get breakfast. Oatmeal, bacon, bread, coffee. Go back for slicker and go up to Battalion Hdqrs. Wanted for figuring payrolls. Must report to Division Hdqrs. Necessary to get my rations first. Back to billet for a towel to wrap two sandwiches in. Start for Hdqrs. with Fox, F Co. man detailed to work with me. After 10 minutes on the road, he calls me Irving or Greenie. Don't know whether to take offense at his forwardness or overlook it. Directions given us for finding Disbursement Officer rather vague. To make matters worse, we lose way. Go much further up road than we should. It has cleared and become very hot. Sun shining strongly. Retrace our footsteps. Ask Tommy to direct us. Eventually find right road. Hdqrs. a fine mansion, beautiful grounds, old trees. Officers of all grades. Necessary to salute all the time we are on road. Find Capt., a small fat man of my faith, thick accent, still retains phlegmatic air of merchant. Men from other Battalions already at work, being instructed in method of figuring payroll, partly on basis of old pay, partly on basis of new. A big job ahead of us. We submit our payroll, which is not found correct in form. Do not wish to take responsibility of making corrections, suggest that corrections be noted and I will return to Co. Clerk to make corrections in compliance with form. Go back, Fox at my heels. Hungry enough to be tempted to eat a sandwich. I turn into a field, sit at the foot of a tree and watch a squad working a field radio a few yards away. Well-rested, walk back leisurely. Consult with clerk about changes. Help him make same. Takes until 11:30. Decide it is best to remain until after mess. Privileged to be served first. Beef stew, bread, coffee. Pick up papers, go in search of Fox. Meet him on road. Walk slowly to destination. More men are there completely taking up available working space. It is only a small hut with one table. Must wait until 2 men finish and go away. Do as much preliminary work as possible while waiting. Get started properly at 3:30. Righted in all details by 4:3O. Decide to go back for mess. Report to Sgt. Major at Batt. Hdqrs. Asks us to come back at 8:00 tomorrow morning. Too busy to go into matters with us. Major holding an important conference. He came back from observations at front this morning and is back in harness again, a hard worker. Dispose of remaining sandwich on way back. Mess is bully beef, bread, coffee, jam. Back to billets. Sit under a tree far back in field to write. Disturbed by mosquitoes. Write until 8:00. Rest for an hour before it grows dark. Answer a lot of questions, which are put to me by boys who are anxious to be paid. Make bed. Turn in. Sleep for a few hours. Must go outside for a minute. The door of the barn is closed, in darkness. I cannot find my way to door. Step on man's feet. Frighten him. Frighten myself. Change direction, guiding myself by hole in the wall through which a gleam of light shows. Find I am walking on mans face. He catches my feet, cries out. Remain where I am, for safety's sake. Ask him for a match. He has one handy. Lights a cigarette with it. I find my way to door. Look out to a clouded sky. Can see red flashes in distance as guns roar. Would like to stay out, but being barefooted and cold, I tuck under covers, again guided by light of cigarette of man I had disturbed. I cannot sleep for a long while after. I tremble with the ground which reverberates with the shock of the firing. I have a queer waking dream. I see myself doing clerical work until I am commended for efficiency, installing new systems, being recommended for a commission and so on. Slumber fitfully rest of night. Not feeling well, a headache comes on to add to my troubles. News of allied successes comes to us, which I think is deserved after such continuous bombardment. Kept up all day long without a stop. Little air activity noted. Tobacco issued for 4 day's supply. Cigarette ration cut down to one pack.

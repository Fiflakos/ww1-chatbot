Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 9 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Jul. 9, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Warm Health: Poor Up at 7:00. Very much determined not to appear on the work squad, no matter what the cost to me. Stomach feeling better and not wanting much breakfast, I make myself a few pieces of toast and have a cup of coffee. Wash and go upstairs to read. I have no intention of reporting to Hdqrs. of company which holds CA 5. Pottering about upstairs, making my bed and putting things in order, when I am told I am wanted by someone below. I know who it is and mutter a curse under my breath. Sgt. Hamond. He wants me. I tell him I will report sick and will see in the meantime what the Lt. has done to get me off. That suits him. He is reasonable. All he wants me to do is go with him to Hdqrs. He leaves on a bicycle and after I have gone upstairs for my mask and cap, I follow. Come up with the work squad and Sgt. at Boyau entrance near Capt.'s quarters. Sgt. suggests that I talk to Acting Capt. I do so. He is in dugout. Not the Lt. I had in mind, but after questioning him as politely as I can, I see that I have been laboring under a false impression. I begin by 211telling him I would like to report sick, then explain to him that I object to working with the prisoners and tell him why. Also ask if I may not be spared entirely, since I have reported, and then be able to return with the men when they leave tonight. He cannot allow that, I am free for the day to do as I wish and he would explain to the Capt. of the company taking over the position tonight, the circumstances. That satisfies me. On my way back I stop in at the infirmary and get some pills for gassy stomach, some for dysentery and some ointment for my foot, which I dress in the kitchen when I get back. Take a pill, which makes me feel worse. Go to bed and sleep until 12. For dinner there is steak, potatoes, tomato sauce, bread, and coffee. I have a slice of toast, some potatoes and coffee. That is a mistake. I should not have eaten anything. There is nothing for me to do. I stay in the kitchen and listen to the sympathetic advice of the boys who would like me to go along with them tonight. Discussing what punishment should be meted out to the men at Batt. Hdqrs, who are the cause of the trouble I am in. Go upstairs and read Torchy and wait for an opportunity to speak to Lt. He does not appear until 4 o'clock. He sees that I have a complaint to make, before I say a word. Offers me a cigarette and light, diplomatically. I am not to be disarmed. Explain to him, I object to being considered a prisoner, and while I have no fondness for carrying arms, I feel keenly the degradation of having my automatic pistol taken away from me. Of course, he does not blame me. No man of spirit would permit such treatment without objecting. But as much as he would like to help me, the order must be carried out. I suggest that I have reported for work. Why not let the matter drop? He will consult with K Co. Capt. who takes over command of prisoners. He will call me later in the day. Men are preparing to leave. Tell them I will probably be with them. Think it an outrage if I do not go with them for a rest. They begin to roll packs. So do I, thinking that either way, if I go or not, I must move from here. The feeling of joy among the boys at being relieved gives vent in a desire to break things. They smash a number of pieces of crockery, sing songs and fight among themselves. Supper. Beef stew, bread, coffee. I take only broth and vegetables of the stew, thinking meat harmful. Broth is too peppery. Noticed by all. Perhaps the reason for a most uncomfortable time from then until far into the night. A severe attack of gastritis. I do not feel equal to the task of carrying a pack, but to escape punishment and to be with my own men, I will risk it. Orders to be ready at 8 PM. Nothing said about me. I lie on my back in bed for relief of cramps until then. Men assemble outside in command of Sgt. Lt. not around. Has he gone off and left me stranded? That is a seamy trick that I did not expect of him. Four men have been left behind. Two for duty on GPOP(?)-one each at company Hdqrs. Perhaps I will receive word from Lt. that I can go in time to move with the men. Learn upon inquiry that it is possible, for Lt. has not left yet. He is out with Lt. Godfrey. New men take possession. Three of them in an advance party. I explain to them why I am here. Write until it is dark, then lie down again for a nap. I am belching excessively, gas from my stomach leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. At 10:30 entire detachment of scouts comes in. I am looked upon askance. In whispers they ask each other who I am. I tell them that 4 of us stay until tomorrow morning. I tell them about lights and precautions they should take to screen them. Post them on where things can be put and found, disposition of bunks, etc. Read Torchy until 11:30, when they are all settled and ready to go to bed. Put out lights and lie in the dark, feeling miserable mentally and physically. Must go downstairs. A pitch dark, moonless, starless night. Know my way about 212well enough to get about. Ellbogan comes in at 12:30. Tell him I will bunk with him until the morning. My pack has not been unrolled. He kindly offers me the use of his blankets. I decline with thanks, as I am warm enough to do without covers. Not long before I must go out again. Decide to take a pill for dysentery. I had not bothered with them till now. Gives me immediate relief. Draft coming in through window is strong. I search for my hat in the dark but cannot find it. Were it not for the discomfort the breeze causes me, I would have been asleep long ago. with approaching daylight, I feel fairly well and rest easily. The day's activities have been below normal. Only a few aeroplanes up and shelling is done by the French only so far as I know. No concentrated fire, that would strike one who is accustomed to hearing them go over as only work on the part of the artillery to keep their guns from getting rusty and themselves from falling asleep. I hear there is mail at Battalion Hdqrs. I am anxious to get it if there is any for me. Ask the men to see that it is forwarded if they can arrange that for me. Being stranded without mail from home is worst form of punishment possible.

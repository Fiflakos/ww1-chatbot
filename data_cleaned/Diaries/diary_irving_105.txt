Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 29 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. May 29, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Look for and find a fragment of bomb in hole 200 yds. south of camp. A jagged piece of steel, which means instant death if struck by it. Up at 6:00. Frost on our tent. Wash. Police. Air blankets. A few shells dropped by enemy at same points. He saves them for our amusement at meal times. Breakfast. Bacon, coffee, bread. Rest for an hour, in which I read last letters from Leah over again. Looks for a time as if we were not going out. This is rapidly becoming a lazy man's haven. Raison, ....... and I will go for water. Our party goes with Lt. We will meet up with them when finished with detail. Another party is to finish up work on observation post. Go about our work very leisurely. Read bulletins of war progress at divisional headquarters. It begins to look like rain. Take in blankets and set out to find Lt. and his class, carrying our slickers. See him just as he moves on over trenches. Leads us a merry dance around ditches and wires until we catch up with him. They are doing nothing in particular. Going over lines, Examining wires for openings. Sets out for a stone pile across the road, once a windmill blown up by English for obstructing field of fire. Take another look at F Company line. Told to take especial note of it. See a party of men looking at trench system through our glasses. Try to locate our OP. I find it in a few minutes. Head towards it to ascertain progress of working party there. Through glasses we take a look at officers in trench. They are all US men. Wade takes my glasses and recognizes about a dozen of them. Later they come out to road going towards us. We find that all of them but our Major are strangers. Go back to house. Nothing to do till mess, so I take a nap. Kaiser adds a touch of spice to our meal as he has done now for the last few days. Stew, hard tack, coffee. I ask Lt. if we go for bath. It depends on whether other battalion scouts go. Sends me to inquire. Find no arrangements to bathe have been made, because we would be needed to escort battalion to trenches when they arrive late afternoon. Boys grumble. Prospects of much needed bath and an afternoon's rest from work are shattered. Take another nap until 2. A task found for us. We go to trench on hill crest south of camp to observe movements of Lt. and two men with him in trench to the north, about 300 yds. distant. I observe, Gillece records. Observation difficult on account of clouds from smoke bombs Englishmen have thrown in pasture for practice. Scotsmen rather, who have been at sham battle all day. A small field of vision with glasses and a large sector to observe make it difficult to spot movement. We know something is going on all the time but cannot locate or detect men. I look for a half hour during which time I note only one movement. Pass glasses to Gillece. He does not do much better. In all when called to assemble only 5 observations were taken. One man only, who had a telescope noted nearly all that went on. Lt. looks over reports. Quite satisfied with our work. Tells us to prepare for a night class to assemble at 8:30. Purpose to get location of points in our trench system by night. Write until supper time. Mess. Cheese, bread, jam, coffee. I am becoming tired of the sameness of that diet. Take another nap. Third during day. Two observation balloons up southwest. They are the target for countless German shells. Our planes over lines are having an interesting time dodging shells and machine gun fire in attempts to cross line. Spend an hour or more observing action through glasses. Enemy still trying for RR and road to north. Class assembled. Lt. grows impatient waiting for darkness to fall. It is chill. Suggests we take our overcoats. He has his on. Rather than disturb our bedpack, we do without. Wear steel helmets, have cap underneath to keep my head warm. I remembered last experience with helmets when my head was cold. we all carry sticks. Play tunes with them on helmet of leading man as we go to the other side of woods through path. On arrival it is too light to send out parties. Wait 15 minutes at G. Companys dugouts. Talk to Australians at work thereon. Big action on ahead of us. Shells whiz all around us and cause Lt. to change plans. Had intended to send party out to stone pile, but is afraid to let men stray too far from him, so as to be near in case of accident. I am asked to lead two men to F. Co. by shortest route, I strike out in full confidence, though I am not very familiar with location, and reach objective without least difficulty. Stay down in trench for warmth. Look ahead over parapet. Flashes of red from guns as far East and West as the eye can see. Boom, boom, boom. Whiz, whiz, whiz until I am sickened by the cruelty of it. How can men inflict such misery and suffering on each other. At every report from the larger guns, I stand with bated breath waiting for the explosion of the shell. I imagine the toll of injury and death it takes. The cost of it. The futility of it. The war will never be won on the field of battle. Why not end it all and spare men and women. Flares, signal lights, machine guns. Almost all the machinery of war exposed to our view. I fail to see grandeur or glory in it. Airplanes over us traveling with lights. Look like moving stars. There is an example of greatness of man but it is being degraded by use to which these machines are put. Whistle for assembly blows at 10:15. Lt. comes up. Parties come together, all but one. We wait and scout for them. After 15 minutes conclude that they have gone back to dugout. Make our way to it in silence intending to steal upon them unawares. They are ignorant of our approach. They are scolded for poor work. All go back through path in woods, over wire and trenches in darkness. Difficult to see man ahead. Millions of stars, beautiful sight but no moon to be seen. Chilled on arrival at camp. I eat an onion for warmth. Searchlights and guns play into the sky trying to find German plane above us. I am afraid they will keep me awake again tonight. A shell or bomb drops in the woods behind us, so close that it makes me hot all over. A few more play on road and then I fall asleep for the first time, enjoying an unbroken night's rest despite the din.

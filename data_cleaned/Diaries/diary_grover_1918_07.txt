Made engagement to have teeth pulled. Tea with C battery. Notes. 1 Roses is definitely what Grover wrote. I cant believe he was referring to live flowers, it must have another meaning such as candied rose petals or perhaps rose candy. See the entry for July 3 also. Here is a suggestion from one forum member: He could have been talking of Rose Hips {i.e. the seed head of the Rose} & a food stuff,& used for Rose Hip syrup to this day as a source of Vitamin C. If he had been hedgerow Fruit picking, Cherries & Currants, then Hips could well have been sourced at the same time. Or he may have just been brightening up his Billet with some Fragrant Blooms, attempting to capture some "Normality" amidst the Madness. And from another member: The chocolates "Roses" is still the product of Cadburys but the name was given to the chocolates by Cadburys to honour the name of William Rose of Rose Brothers of Gainsborough who designed and manufactured the cut and wrap packaging machines for Cadbury's sweets 95 years ago and are still produced by the sucessor firm today. 1 Kate Wills from the Great War forum furnished the following: Elsie Janis was born in Columbus Ohio in 1889, and made her theatrical debut at the theatre there at age eight. Success in the US, including Broadway, was followed by instant success on her London debut at the Palace Theatre in 'The Passing Show' on 20th April 1914. Throughout the war she traveled back and forth across the Atlantic, continuing to appear in NY and the West End, including 'The Passing Show of 1915', which included Basil Hallam as 'Gilbert the Filbert. When America entered the war she won fame as 'The Doughboys' Sweetheart', giving performances as near as possible to the front line. In January 1922 she starred in a version of her troop show at the Gaiety Theatre New York 'Elsie Janis and her Gang'. She wrote an autobiography 'So far So good' in 1932. She died in Beverly Hills on Feb. 26, 1956.

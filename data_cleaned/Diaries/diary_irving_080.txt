Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 4 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. May 4, 1918 Weather: Partly cloudy, Cold Health: Good Up at 5:45. Raining. Reveille. Breakfast. Oatmeal, bacon, bread, coffee. Work for morning in doubt. Drill call sounds. Take a chance. In an effort to profit from indecision of commander, I take a shave. Originally planned to roll packs for an early inspection, but weather preventing, do not know whether we will go out for drill or have foot inspection. I do nothing until orders come. Foot inspection by our platoon Sgt. He can do nothing for kink in my leg and discontinue taking off shoes, telling him I am OK. Drill call comes again at 9:00. To go with usual pack. Assembled and go by short cut to drill field #2 where we take things easy. Close order drill, squad skirmish, platoon skirmish drill, manual, etc. Gun inspection. Pass muster. Only a few reported. Not much snap in work of company. Seems more like we are kept out of sight than for any serious purpose. Overhear a conversation between officers which makes it appear likely we will have a formation in afternoon. Decidedly not to my liking. Go back at 12. Mess. Stew, hard tack, coffee. A new batch of men have arrived and are quartered in nearby village. Tell stories of obstacles confronting them on trip across. A railroad wreck, a sub sighted, etc. Make inquiries from men about late news from home. None of importance. Requested to remain about quarters until informed when we are to assemble for march to baths. Told on mess line to be ready at 3. I write a letter to Mother until then, anxious to miss formation. I do not fancy walking for half an hour for a probable cold bath, when I can take one at the pump. Urged to go by corporal who will have to account for me. I stay behind to gather up towel, socks and soap. Arrive at assembly point after company leaves. Go back, get soiled clothes as I had planned to do and take them to field , where I scrub them in cold water in tub. Hang them to dry, or rather spread them on grass to dry. Write a letter to Sachs. Sun is hot and bright. Welcome change from forenoon when it was so chill and cold, that I feared consequences, having very thin underclothing, only blouse for protection. Feels comfortable and pleasant to lie on grass, sun on back, writing to boys. I can tell them quite cheerfully of my experiences on trip across and in billet. Disturbed occasionally. Make plans to go to city about 10 kilometers distant for Sunday outing. Go up for supper. Cheese, bread, marmalade, coffee. Beginning to acquire a taste for marmalade. Passed it up frequently before. Get some from boys who cannot become accustomed to it, to save for tomorrow. Write while it is still light. Clothes on grass have become damp from dew by now. Pick them up, hang on line. Make bed and tuck in shortly after. Bunkmate a little under the influence of liquor. Talkative and confused but sober enough to be a gentleman. As usual Tommy and Fritz have taken advantage of the half holiday to bang away at each other's wire. Sustained fire kept up, beginning at about 2 and running well into the night. Disturbs my slumbers by its intensity. Considerable rumbling. Reilly reports having gone outside at 3 AM and having seen flashes of fire as firing is done. Appears to him to be quite near. He is much amazed at what he sees. Talks much about it. Airplanes active all afternoon, flying very high in both directions. Occasional firing done. Cannot ascertain purpose or results. Boys think favorably of going on excursion tomorrow with Reilly and me in early forenoon after they have returned from church service. A few letters have come in from Ireland and England for the boys. It seems to me about time that some have come from the States. There is no need to censor such letters, so if they have come as reported it is time they were distributed. Letters have been returned to men by base censor on account of improper address. Thomas of our squad has received a money order from home for a large sum of francs and has gone to the city to cash it. Does not return. Absent since yesterday. If apprehended, punishment in store for him will be very severe. Thompson from another platoon with him to help him spend money.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 2 January 1918. Location: Barracks Camp Uptown. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. Jan. 2, 1918 Weather: cold, clear Health: fair Read Newspapers - Peace Prospects Pleasing Late for reveille. Our names are taken but we are excused. Breakfast, oatmeal, bacon, coffee. Payroll to be signed. Read. Signal practice in Recreation Room. Spread out our equipment on bed to check it. Helmets given to boys by Com. McMurtry. Mirrors and hooks for hanging clothes in latrines. Now best latrine in camp. Best equipped company. On guard in latrine 12-12:30. Dinner, soup, beans and coffee. A bag of hard candy for each man. On guard 1:30-3 in latrine. In barracks to put away equipment, read and take nap. Outside for retreat, very cold, with guns. Supper, beef stew, apple butter, bread, coffee. At Retreat, a list of eleven men were ordered to report to Supply Sgt. Griffiths. Rumor immediately has it that these men are to go South. Great excitement. Rosenbaum and ten other new men to go. Men are to go to Concord, North Carolina Camp at 6:45 in the morning. A hasty move to send telegrams and telephone the folks at home. An effort made to procure passes until then to say goodbye. Refused. I feel sorry for Rosenbaum, who has not been home since arrival here, and am greatly worried about myself. It is not definite as to whether more men will go. I cannot think of anything else but Leahs feelings, if I should go. After supper, I make my bed and read. Shave, wash and tuck in at 9:15. Lay awake and think of the swift unkind way of sending men away from home. Kiss Leahs picture, say prayers and fall asleep before Im finished.

Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 2nd October 1914. Location: Barracks Camp. Nationality: Australian. Friday October 2ndLeave from 5. to 9.p.m.Called the camp at 5.30 thismorning so that the tent orderleyscan go on parade and still do theirwork. This is unecessary if everybodywas honest & willingThe Colonel announced that therewould be no further leave grantedand special leave only until 9.pm.in very important cases.The ruling is certainly annoying andis brought about by the drunken misbehaviourof the infantry crowd whoare to be seen in the streets at allhours of the night. Special police havebeen engaged to clear the town.I went to Manly withAnnie Stout and saw Mrs. Hynes.about her getting a room down there.I enjoyed the trip immensely andgave me a fountain pen.Camp by 9 o'clock.

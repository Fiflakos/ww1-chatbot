Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 5 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. Jun. 5, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good A year ago today we registered. How time does fly! Up at 6:00. Hurry to get breakfast. Our meals until further notice will be excellent, supplemented by what Co. has bought. Bacon, potato, jam, bread, coffee. Wash, after which I report to Battalion Hdqrs. at once. Work on correction in E. Co.'s payrolls until Lt. comes. He has been requested to make other changes, which he tells me of. I am kept busy making them until 11:00 o'clock. I am again told that perhaps I will be taken to work in new Bureau. Many officers, including the Colonel, have been in this morning, and all of them have discussed the best piece of news we have heard since we have been in France. We have been rejected by the British and go South, probably to an American Base. Our English rifles, ammunition and machine guns will be turned in and exchanged for the material we brought over with us. Captain takes men to ......... where an American YMCA has come up, to make whatever purchases of cigarettes, candy and crackers, etc. they need and tells them the good news. He has them gather in a circle for the purpose. Their cheers could be heard from where I was. An entirely different spirit in the army this morning. Cheering at intervals all day. Everybody is given the afternoon off to do their washing, shave, etc. When everybody leaves the office to take payrolls to paymaster, Sgt. Newton and I stay for a few minutes talking of the Lt. He asks me would I like to work for him. I would very much like to. We go out together. I buy some chocolate and in conversation I tell him I would like to take a bath this afternoon. He offers to give me a bicycle. Thank him and go to quarters. To my surprise the whole company is in billets. They are resting. A YMCA wagon is in front of orderly room door, selling American cigarettes, cigars, nuts, crackers, chocolate, etc. They do a land office business. Prices are reasonable. Office lends 5 Frs. to any man who wished it, till payday. I buy 4 bars of chocolate for 3 Frs., which is 1/2 the price we pay to French in village and 10 times as good in quality. All our plans must be changed. I cannot do my washing, as all the cans are taken. I must wait. Lie down until mess. A reminder of our Camp Upton meals. Beef stew, dried apricots, cocoa. Another plate of stew. Belly full and glad we go with our own men. A feeling of contentment. Find a bucket, heat water, boil clothes, wash and hang to dry. Duty to myself fulfilled, I pay my debt to Leah and write her a letter of 6 pages, in good vein, I am pleased to think. Inconvenient writing in prone position, I grow very tired. Written while on my back, stomach, side and a few minutes while sitting. It takes me a long time, well up to supper. Another surprise for us. Corned beef and new cabbage, cheese, jam, coffee. I get a heaping plate of bully and cabbage and I can barely put it all away. I have a heavy stomach the remainder of the night. Go back to my writing until I finish. Write until 8. Fix up my tent, which was partly taken down to give contents an airing, make my bed and go to Batt. Hdqrs. to mail it. Mail not being taken in orderly room. Get a few more envelopes from mail clerk, quite a privilege. I forget to mention that immediately after supper at 6 o'clock, I go to .......... for a bath. Falkowski, our company in charge, gives us lots of water and, detail being small, we take unlimited time. A most refreshed young man for the rest of the day, cool and clean. Entire company to have gone, but most of men are out celebrating in lieu of changing their surroundings. Others took advantage of the afternoon hours to go there, without an order, being permitted to bathe by Corp. On the way, I see a stream, such a rare occurrence that it is worthy of note. Shell hole near baths seen. This is one which was corporal Hamilton's nemesis, explosion of shell wounding him. A beautiful village as seen from the road surrounded by trees and nestling on a hilltop. Go back at our ease with Kronenberg. After mailing my letter, I lie down to rest without undressing and almost fall asleep. Decide to undress and go to bed at 10 o'clock. Restless for a long time. After 3 sleep soundly. During the day there has not been much activity but at night the combatants get busy. In jest we say, Fritz is aware of our leaving and is giving as a proper send-off. It is quite as fierce a battle as any we have ever heard. In the air we are quite certain that Fritz has a number of his airmen up on the job. Our men are vigilant. Patrol the air until late at night. Boys getting very careless, showing lights from their tents during night, after dark. They write by candlelight and light matches for their pipes and cigarettes without any attempts at concealment. The Englishmen in town are not very much pleased that we are leaving. So much more that they will have to do when the time comes for fighting hard. For our part, we are glad that we were not called upon to assist them. While I was finishing letter to Leah shots were heard at short intervals, which I am certain mark the passage of a chicken at each report. My conclusion proves correct when a lad comes with a story of how he was beaten when he protested and informed when the hen was shot. He is ridiculed by the boys for not having returned the blows he received. Men from schools come back during the afternoon and report that the English are probably preparing to retreat. They are strengthening position at the farm. Cutting down hedges and trees and preparing for attack. One story has it that we hike for three days when we move. I believe Sweet has been given job at Personnel Bureau in place of me.

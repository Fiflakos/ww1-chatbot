Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 29 June 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Jun. 29, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Fair Hike to Battalion Hdqrs. at ........ and to ........ to take up duties. Sleep in a bed, in a room, where there are roses on the table in a vase. I am the first awake at 8. This gang is getting lazy. They are still asleep. I must wake them. It is perhaps past breakfast time. There would be much grumbling if they should miss breakfast. They realize the importance of getting out quickly. Go up together. Rubin has orders to bring me bread and coffee. I am feeling much improved. Look over what I wrote to Leah yesterday. Do not find anything of interest in it. Decide to destroy it and begin anew after breakfast. Lie down while I wait for men to come back. Aeroplanes are up on both sides and are being fired at. Frenchman, who hit Del Duca's pistol yesterday, is at practice again. I get nervous, but decide that I am just as safe where I am as any place else. Bring me rice, bread and coffee. I start fire to warm coffee. Boys admire my patience while I try to keep it burning. They declare I cannot be very sick if I can spend so much time over fire. General, Major and Adjutant, also Colonel are out looking over their sector. They almost come in upon us, so close do they come. Yet, we are not aware we are being observed. I do not believe they know our position. I plan to do some washing, before I begin to write. Take too much time to decide whether I will or not. He who hesitates will not wash, so 10 o'clock finds me writing a letter to Leah. I go over events of yesterday. At twelve oclock I am still writing. Take I off my shoes and stockings, leggings and blouse for greater comfort. Dinner time comes. I am urged to go to mess. Dress so that I can. Take paper, pen and ink with me, in the event that I must wait. I can improve the shining hour. It is indeed a shining hour, a red hot sun and a beautiful blue sky. Mess has not yet arrived. I sit with my back to a sapling and resume writing, which displeases Del Duca. I am made a target for sticks and stones. I am amused when I casually glance at Lenehan. He has had his hair cut. Barber leaves a tuft of hair in the center of his head, which gives him a most ludicrous appearance. He is not aware of the barber's joke. Mess arrives. I do not care for anything, but coffee. I get a cup and some bread. Coffee is hot and creates an appetite. I get some steak too, which I relish. I do not remain very long, fearing I will be sent back with the dixies. Return at once to my writing room. Lukas goes to YMCA in town to get crackers and newspapers. Returns with crackers for me. Write undisturbed until 4:30, munching crackers, birds my only companions. Men are away to town or with rest of company. Writing a very long letter. Sgt. Fiske calls. Gillece and I are to roll packs and report to Batt. Hdqrs. at 5:00. It is almost 5 now and quite impossible to carry out orders. Remember my experience of Thursday and finish my letter writing without hurrying. My greatest accomplishment for Leah if my letter arrives safely, 20 pages. Roll my pack. Work quickly but do not hurry, for Gillece has not yet come. Look at my rifle. It is nearly all rust. Make a hurried cleanup. Men are back. Have had a good supper. None left for me. I know where I can get some. Say good-bye. Will see comrades later. Company moves into lines later to-night. Sling pack and we are off. Some hard trudging going up hill. Fortunately, heat of day is over. Go slowly as I possibly 192can, yet I perspire so that I am wet through. Steep hill knocks us out for a time. We must rest. Stop in kitchen to fill our water bottles. Get doughnuts and bread for my supper. Keep pack on. Perspiring and panting. Eating in that condition increases my stomach distress. Go on to Hdqrs. in woods without a halt. Sgt. Fiske waiting for us. Others there. As I expected, we do not start until dark. I no longer grow angry when, on arriving an hour or more after appointed time, I am told that we are hours too early. Unsling my pack. Talking to Tallon who is grouchy. A message is to go to E Co. from Hdqrs. Sgt. Fiske suggests that I take it. I protest that I am tired and wringing wet. No avail. I must go. Go off road two or three times. Manage to get to our Co. Hdqrs. See Captain to whom I deliver message. No answer in return. It is much easier going up hill without pack. Company going up hill singly to assemble in wood. Aeroplanes are up to observe movement. Quickly spotted and fired at. On way back stop in kitchen for a few more doughnuts. Lose path on way back to Hdqrs. A fine scout am I. Lose 15 minutes finding direction. Dusk when I get back. Not yet ready to start. Get news of A Co. 3 casualties. One gas case, serious, 2 slight shrapnel wounds. Reread letter to Leah, while I wait. Off through forest road at 9:15. See nothing of E Co. Sgt. Major in a hurry. Too fast a pace and no rests. Through ........ where Hdqrs. will be. Stop there to rest and await further orders. Expect for a time to be quartered there. Orders to move on to ........ . Gillece and I set out alone. To war at last. A dark road for a half mile through the town. Quiet as death. A column of ghosts coming toward us. Think I recognize Lt. Griffiths. No. To our left, signals rising, white and ghostlike into the darkness of the sky. Gillece suggests we load and lock our rifles. Not a bad idea. I think more than I talk. Asked what I would do to a German. Nothing, I do not want to see any. A trifle nervous and perspiring. Sit down to rest against a wall to regain my composure. Off again in ten minutes. Meet limbers. Ask if we are on right road to make sure that we will not wander about all night. A camouflaged road all the way out. Walking at a fast pace brings us into town at 12. Only one sentry stopped us on road. In town there are more. Nothing to be seen but ruins, every house in the town torn by shells. A light at junction of main street and road, coming through shuttered windows. Perhaps these are the sentries. A French canteen. One man inside going over accounts, turns to the right. Nobody. A peculiar odor. Gas? Stop to sniff. Undecided. Iodine? Yes! Next, a guard. He does not know where we can find Lt. Leaves his post to inquire, a foolish move. Comes out with definite information of value. Next place where a light shows, we are to inquire. Ruins everywhere. Another guard comes up in the darkness. A ray of light through a window. A familiar voice from a dim figure. Kenny. He does not know where Lt. is. Black will know. Here he comes. All the men are here. So glad to see them, as after absence of years. We follow them in direction from which we came. A column of troops coming in. Lt. not yet arrived. Halt at a house still intact. Shown where a shell struck a few hours before, smashing wall and street. Himpler and Maloy on guard. Ask us to relieve them. For some unexplainable reason I object, aggressively. Inside. Once a rich man's place. Holy pictures on walls. Beds, quite a few of them in rooms. Screened candles for light. Windows shaded. Unpack. Rest. Discuss question of guard. Draw lots. Three more shifts to be done. 6 of us present. 3 numbered slips, 3 blanks. I draw a blank. No guard for me. Gillece from 2 to 4. To ring klaxen and wake men. Edit Leah's letter before I go to bed, because I find some free censor envelopes about. Just what I have been looking for. To bed, fully clothed. Town 193is frequently shelled so it is not advisable to remove clothes. Wonder if Leah knows that I am in danger; that I have walked cautiously through a ruined city, ready to take a life or protect my own. E Co. comes in while I sleep and go into line, unnoticed. No activity of any kind comes to my knowledge. Maloy has a swollen face, which reminds me that he slept near Ferguson, who died of Anthrax. I question him as to how he feels. He thinks it is an insect bite. Biggest adventure.

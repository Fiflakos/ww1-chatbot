Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Tue. Jul. 16, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Good Chiefly notable for "Eats" Throndsen calls me at 6. I feel much better. I have had a good nights sleep. I get up quickly and dress, reporting for duty before I wash. He suggests I have breakfast first. I look about me. I am pleased with what I see. Pancakes, three of them, syrup, strawberry jam and bread, and real coffee, two cups, with real milk and lots of sugar. As to the manner born, I go through with it, complaining, when H......., the cook, offers me potatoes also, that I am sick and therefore must not eat too much. Ready now for a pipe and then I wash myself at the pump in the square. Cold, invigorating, running water. After which I get to work washing dishes, sweeping the floor, etc. When I am finished, Throndsen has a job for me. 223Upstairs is a bathtub. It is full of garbage and putrid water. He wants me to clean it out so that the Captain may take a bath when he awakes at 11:30. I feel like kicking, but I decide to wait and see if the details go on any work. It is a nasty stinking job. I am not anxious to work too fast. Not looking for any speed records on the job, so I get my papers and pen to write a little more to Leah, keeping my ears open for footsteps on the stairs. I am a good imitation of a servant. Throndsen catches me loafing. I tell him a fish story. I go downstairs and get hell from the cook for working upstairs. He needs me, so I finish the job quickly, coming downstairs to do his errands. Next I am asked to fill the bathtub with water. I refuse to do that. It is too hot for such work and besides I am not feeling equal to the task of lugging 20 or more dixies of water upstairs. We argue about my disability in the matter, but whether or not I must obey, I am not going to fill a bathtub with water, when I can plead sickness as the excuse. It is finally agreed that I take up 4 dixies full which I consider reasonable. That done, I have other work to do in the kitchen. There is little chance to loaf. I want to clean up as well as I can. Officers come in, the Captain gets out of bed and bathes with the aid of Throndsen. It is more like a mansion here than a soldier's home by the lines. The Captain calling Throndsen, Throndsen for a half hour. He has his dinner served at once. They do not stay long at it. The Captain is a busy, hard worker, and he goes at once to his hdqrs. dugout. Then we have our dinner. Oh boy! Talk about eats. There is German pot roast, and spaghetti, potato salad, brown gravy, pie, apple pie, doughnuts and strawberry jam, bread and jam, and three cups of cafe au lait, with beaucoup sugar. Cook wants wood. I want to sit and ponder over the taucross on door for a few minutes. I say nothing but go out into the garden to take from the line some handkerchiefs which I had washed in the early forenoon. Cook is in a hurry, needlessly, and wants to know if I am an ornament to the kitchen, or do I intend to work. I do not reply. Go about my business and on my way out meet Mess Sergeant and cook conferring. I am called into the conference and asked why I refused to get wood. I tell them I did not refuse so far as I know, but if any "grease ball" talks to me like that again, things will liven up and as far as working is concerned, I refuse to do a tap, which may be told to the Captain, if any one does tell him. I am humored and an attempt is made to calm me. I get wood, refusing to chop same. Prisoners are doing that work. They complain too, but complaining won't do them any good. For the rest of the afternoon the cook makes overtures. I have a bit of beer from him and he offers me a lot of other little snacks. I accept what I fancy. Bear him no ill will. I go out for water. Hear a series of rapid ...... explosions. Planes are up and are being shelled. I cannot distinguish direction or nature of sound, but before my pail is filled, there are two very loud explosions, which shake every building in the place, and sends up a puff of white smoke, or rather a cloud of it. I seek the shelter of a wall until the danger of falling pieces is over. In headquarters everybody is ordered out. There is a meeting of officers, which adjourns to the cellar. I find my gas mask was left behind. I get it and join those in the cellar. We stay until someone mentions that it is an ammunition dump which has exploded, a fact I thought they were aware of. They thought it is shelling. We, who saw the affair from the street, are of the opinion that Jerry hit it with a bomb. He was over that spot a moment before. The afternoon passes quickly. Everything is clean and tidy by 3:30, and while cook prepares a good dinner, I write a bit more of my story to Leah. There is no further complaint about me looking and acting like an ornament. At 6:00, supper is served. 224when his lordship, the Captain has finished, we have steak. I take some cold roast left from the dinner, baked beans, tomato sauce, potatoes, bread and jam, and tea, real tea, not quite as good as Leahs, but the nearest to it I have has since leaving home. 3 cups. Everybody on good terms with each other now. I wash the dishes and the cook dries them and what with the aid of Throndsen, we quickly have the kitchen in ship shape. At 8, I am off for the day. I wash and soap up thoroughly, hair too, and let the stream from the constantly flowing pump play on my head. A most refreshing bath. Fill my canteen for use at night, if necessary, and retire to my parlor to write. Take off my shoes and stockings and open the windows wide, prepared to spend a comfortable evening at home. The flies and mosquitos annoying considerably, while it is light, but after I shut the blinds and light the candle, they disappear. I write on my story for an hour and then other work until 11:30. Candle out, windows wide open, a beautiful cool breeze, making it ideal for sleeping. No one but myself is the room. The two corporals have gone to headquarters dugout, where I imagine they will stay for the night. I fall asleep promptly. At 12:30 they come in, make enough noise to wake me. It takes a half hour for me to go off again, but once asleep, I do not open my eyes until the morning. No news from Stewart. Evidently he is mending. There is little activity during the day. Some artillery firing from both sides only. The ........ road is washed up a bit in the morning.

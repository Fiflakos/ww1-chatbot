Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 23 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. May 23, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Another event in the life of a soldier has come to life and I have gone my way as prescribed in the IOR without mishap. I have slept in a tent and still survive. Only the back of my neck was a trifle cold. Noise unaccustomed to. An opportunity to put into practice a long cherished desire of mine. I wash my feet in the morning dew on the grass. Feels fine. Dry with a handkerchief. Towel is precious, difficult to wash. Assemble for report. Go to farm house to wash. Fill water bottle. English look at tub in which I have just bathed. "Only one" says he and proceeds to use it. Back for breakfast at 7:00. Judge distance by fact that we left at 6:15 and returns so late. No loafing while there. Breakfast. Good bacon, jelly, coffee. The boys coffee goes to the right spot. They make it better than the accredited cooks. Lots of time to eat but an objection is that I cannot let feet hang. My stomach is all doubled up either creeping or crawling or sitting with no back support and outstretched legs. I think of building a bench. Clean my gun thoroughly. It has misted a little from the dew. Will occur every night I presume. Air blankets. Take a peek at porcupine. Himpler goes back to Company for information wanted by Lt. and to report. Remainder of men except sick and kitchen help go out with both Lieuts. to survey our sector of trenches. Leave blouses behind. Take guns which prove a nuisance. Jump over trenches until I am sore in every limb. A bewildering maze of ditches some completed, others under construction by Chinese coolies. I have seen many coolies in France but I have yet to see one of then throw a shovelful of dirt. Study wiring systems, locations and designation of MG emplacements, dugouts, drains, CTs, etc. Every one of the ditches we see is dug with the precision and neatness of work done for exhibition. All very carefully studied out and ordered beforehand. Miles of them. It makes one dizzy to walk through them, following their many turns and deviations. A trip of 11 and one half miles over battalion sector takes 2 and one half hours to complete. We rest for a few minutes at end. Soon after leaving for the return trip Fritz sends over 1/2 dozen or so gas shells not a half mile from where we were. After a horse corral? With the aid of glasses, I believe we can see artillery. Hurry back. It looks like a shower or thunderstorm coming. Mess. Stew, bread, coffee. Very good. I vote to continue cooks in office. Rest. Write a letter to Leah about my new life. Nap while I await call to drill. None forthcoming until 3:00. Maley(?) awakes me telling me that Himpler has returned from Company Hdqrs. with confirmation of the news that Al Ferguson is dead. Anthrax, rarest of diseases is the cause. I had noticed swelling on neck and small pimple. Thought it was mumps. Capt. endeavoring to ship body home. Another casualty in company. Jim Hamilton, Corp. detailed to baths at ........ hit by shell in arm and leg during an air raid in place last night. Enemy raises the devil by night in our Company billets too. Keeps every one alert and ready to move on. Gas masks worn at alert. Clears up sufficiently for us to go out for observation. Do not take blouses though needed. In open the wind blows over us till we are chill. Taking bearings. My job for which I volunteer is to pace along to find openings in work location, and conditions, number of holes, etc. Lt. fussy. Most of the information I give him has been obtained with zealous fidelity to rule. It angers me that what he is doing takes so much of his attention that he cannot listen to me. We go back at 4:30. Write until mess, finishing Leah's letter. Supper. Marmalade, bread, cheese, coffee. Second helping of bread and cheese. Write until 9:00. Help Gillece to construct a bench of logs. He has put in some work on it. We chop down a tree of 6 in. diameter for crosspieces. I do so with a pang of remorse. It is very cold. Damp and misty. If idle and not moving it stings toes. Guard posted. Go to bed. Overcoat for bottom bedding. Sleep with blouse on. Shoulders and feet are cold. Remainder of body warm. Fritz has taken a vacation. During the day no activity noticeable. It is very quiet. Not many planes up. A few shots fired at long intervals. Restless during the night from cold and trouble with the blankets, which insist on moving. Listen intently for sound of German planes. A fascinating sport. I fall asleep. He comes at 4 o'clock. Goes away without doing any damage. Not a favorable night for doing any kind of work, except scouting and patrolling. I forget a duty to baby and Leah. In the morning I observe that settled on each leaf of the trees in forest is black dust. No coal in these parts. It must be powdered charcoal floating about in air and settling on objects about countryside. A sham battle is fought in our grounds by Tommy, which is more play than war. We indulge in the sport, and I have always laughed at one for lacking in seriousness.

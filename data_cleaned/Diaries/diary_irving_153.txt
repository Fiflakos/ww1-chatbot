Jul. 17, 1918 Weather: Fair, Hot Health: Good Some damn fool, who hangs around Hdqrs. and thinks I eat with the plebes at the company kitchen, wakes me at 5:10, telling me I will miss my mess if I don't get up. I dress and fuss around in the kitchen for an hour before the officers have had their breakfast. The Captain is late and must be served separately. We have pancakes galore, syrup, bread and jam and real coffee. Yesterday's good eating has fixed me up in great shape. I feel fine. Begin to think it is a mistake on my part to imagine that the army diet is sufficient. Wash dishes and sweep, get wood and do chores, after which I help the cook make rhubarb pie for dinner. The news that there will be pie spreads rapidly and everybody has a question to ask the cook, and some come in to look for somebody, whom they know cannot be found in the kitchen, all in the hope of getting pie. The juice from the rhubarb we put in a bowl to cool, and all morning we have a cooling summer drink. The Captain and all our visitors have some. Sgt. has had no breakfast. We make him some, which gives me more work washing dishes. Peel potatoes for a half hour, which is the finish of the morning's work. I decide to take a nap, first washing my undershirt, which will dry rapidly in the hot sun. I would like to take a bath this afternoon at the spring. Lie down on my bed. Try to sleep. Discover that I am wide awake. It is very hot. The general opinion is that to-day is the hottest day of the year. The flies bother me. Hundreds of them walking over my face and head constantly. I must get up to put a towel over my head. Aeroplanes overhead can be seen from my window, where I lie. Fritz is again shelling the road, which is closed to traffic. I get no sleep but a fairly good rest until 11:30. Throndsen calls me to help him with the water for the Captain's bath. That business annoys me terribly, but since it is the only disagreeable detail of a day's work, I do not complain. I go back to bed for a few minutes, until the officers are ready for mess. The Captain has no time to eat. He is called 225away to attend to the moving back of two platoons and the relocation of Hdqrs. Dugout. After officers are satisfied, we have bacon, lyonnaise potatoes, carrots and peas, lettuce salad, rhubarb pie, bread and jam, tea 2 cups. Quite a feed for a private. Throndsen helps with the dishes. We are done with our work quickly. I have time off which is spent in writing. Go to my room, remove my shoes and leggings and sit in bed at work on my story. It is interesting work. I have decided to elaborate on it to give Leah as much pleasure as possible. Ludwig, company clerk of this organization, gives me an idea, which is an excellent one. In the garden are some red, white, and blue flowers. He has pressed them in a book and pasted them on a card to send home. I must do likewise. For a long time I have wanted to send home a flower and now I have found a way, but I am angry with myself for having to copy. I wish I could do something original. Leah will be immensely pleased with it, I know. My undershirt is dry, so I wash my OD shirt. I write for two hours in my room, seated on my bed. The Captain sees me a number of times, as he passes along the hall. Later in the day he asks Ludwig if I am needed. He answers "yes". The flies bother me a great deal while I work. They drive me to give up my writing and I find myself with a half hour's time on my hands, which I cannot give a good account of. Supper is delayed again by the Captain. He is very busy. Shuler picks currants for to-morrows pie. When the Captain comes in, he brings with him a mess kit full, which he himself has picked. That man certainly likes to eat well. Supper is hash, potatoes, stewed corn, bread, coffee, jam. I am growing fat under the treatment I am receiving. A visible change has taken place in me since yesterday. Wash the dishes and with the help of Throndsen, who dries them, we are done by 8:30. Wash myself at the pump. It is good, on a day as hot as today, especially. My OD shirt is dry enough to put on. I dress and go to Scout Headquarters for my tent poles and pins which I have left behind. Meet Archer whom I ask about Sgt. Stewart's condition. No word about him has been received. Renny is still there having asked to be permitted to remain. He is himself again, having completely forgotten about the incident of the other day, from which I judge that Stewart is mending nicely. Archer has some aeroplane photographs, something which I have been looking for, for a long time. In my opinion, if I can get them home, they would be the best possible souvenir. I would like one for myself. He tells me there is a stack of them downstairs in the cellar of the building and without further parley goes to get some of them for me. I am most grateful. He hands me more than a dozen of them. I stay to chat with him for a few minutes, going back to my quarters at once. Then I pick a red and white rose and some blue flowers, putting them in a book to press. I sleep on it, using it for a pillow. Light my candle, shut the window, take off my shoes and leggings and prepare to write. I give Ludwig a few of the pictures in return for the good idea he gave me in reference to the flowers. I get a bar of chocolate, the regular issue from the cook. Lying on my belly, I finish my story but think to add to it by putting another page or two at the beginning, describing my eating, etc. It is growing late, hot and stuffy. I write a little while longer, blow out my candle and go to Sleep. With the windows open, it is delightfully cool. There is a fine breeze blowing, which draws through the building and slams doors and windows shut. I am a little bit worried about events to-night. Everybody is either moving back or has already moved out of the town, as if a forward movement by the Germans is expected. Company is occupying a new line. Some 1st Battalion men come up in advance, which 226dispels a rumor that the regiment was going to Italy. I hear the men from our company are drilling at ........ instead of resting. In the morning I reread Leah's last letters. No activity of any kind to-day. Only a few aeroplanes up, and a few stray small arms shots fired. What with the meals and the quiet, war is to make life easy......... Patrol of 3rd Battalion Scouts out on patrol come in without having encountered anything worthy of note. No accident or incident until they are in quarters when Bennett discharges his gun into the wall.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 17 April 1918. Location: At Sea in Danger Zone. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wednesday April 17, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Cold Health: Bad neuralgia in morning At Sea, In Danger Zone Up at 6:00. Up on deck for Reveille. Remain on deck for smoke. Downstairs to wash and make bed. Lie down until breakfast. I have a splitting neuralgia headache. Nose in same condition. Take some menthol jelly for clearing it. No improvement. Breakfast. Porridge, fish, bread and butter, coffee. Warmth of it very gratifying. Take a look about on deck. Cruiser has left us, evidently some time during the night. Now riding alone in close order. See some gulls and flying fishes. Forced to go below to lie down and hold my head. Captain comes and orders every man on deck. Asks me whats wrong? Tell him but he insists orders are carried out. Try to find a spot where there is no wind. Get behind donkey engine and lie down, head well covered. Wind comes around corners and causes me distress. Take a chance of being caught and punished and go downstairs. Medical officers and ship's officers in hold for inspection, no other visitors to be feared. I lie down and get a little relief in sleep. News brought down that we have picked up our convoy. I must go up to see also. Prettiest sight I ever saw at sea. Most interesting moment in trip. We immediately proceed to run faster. Boat makes again as much speed as before. Ship's name plate put up. Spray covering decks with water from both sides. Wind created by motion of ship so great that it hurts my head. I was going downstairs when order comes for all men in our company to get their rifles when names are called. We must relieve guard company at once. A case of measles has been discovered in C Company. Must go into quarantine at once. Guard duty falling on us next in order. We must relieve them 4 hours earlier. My name called. Get rifle and fall in for first relief. Given an inside post fortunately. Amuse myself watching officers at mess. Corridor becomes draughty. I swap a post for one further down aisle. At 2:30 boat drill. Still no relief forthcoming. I am very hungry. Relief does not come till 3:00. Head- ache has abated. Having that to be thankful for, hunger is minor matter. Meet a boy who has apples from canteen. Hold him up for 2. For a long time I have not had any. Go to dining hall, where rest of guard is being messed. Find food all gone. More boys come in as they are relieved, making 20 in all who have had nothing to eat since breakfast. Most of them manage to pick up an apple. Wait and protest, but ship's officers will not feed us. Sgts. and Corporals acquaint Captain and 1st Lts. with situation. They try their best to procure food for us but fail. Lt. manages to get some coffee for us. Boys would rather wait until supper. We steal 4 loaves of bread and some butter. Have words with Mess attendant. Outcome after a lecture by Lt. on a soldier's hardships is that we are given supper half an hour in advance. We must eat it in a hurry to make room for regularly assigned men. Bread, jelly, lima beans and bacon, coffee. Welcome and good. I do not go to my own mess for supper. Read for an hour and take a nap. On guard again from 7-9. Ship rolling and pitching very much. Vibrations from engines very much. Uninteresting two hours except for my thoughts which again are of home. Relieved. Have an apple and a half and go to bed for 3 hrs. On guard again from 2-4. Clock set 66 minutes ahead. Sleepy post. Relieved at 4. Go to bed. Head aches again. Restless.

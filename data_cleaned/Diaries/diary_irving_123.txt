Out like a lion" Off to the C......... Up at 6:00. It is raining so heavily I deem it improbable, Reveille or formation will be held. Lie abed. Reveille, rain or no rain, but Sgt. having difficulty getting men out of tents. In great haste I reach for my shoes. Find that it has rained into one of them. Socks are damp. Slow down because I realize it is impossible to appear on time. Get word to squad leader to report me present which he does. I remain in shelter until mess line shortens. Crawl out in full view of Lt. C. I eye him narrowly. He seems to bear me no grudge. I hardly think it possible that my absence should go unnoticed but it has! A bully breakfast of rice, prunes and figs, bread, karo and tea. Very uncomfortable for two to eat in our little tent. Rubin crawls in rubbing inner surface of tent cloth, causing water to come through. Thereafter a steady drip until noon when a pal suggests we rub entire interior surface which attracts drip to bottom. We are all much perturbed over possibility of forming for drill. It would be a sorry day for us if drill were contemplated. By 1:30 nothing said. Mail given out. I have 3 letters from Leah, one from Mama. Good cheer reigns at home, Thank God. All are well. No drill, mind at ease again about things at home, I am in a mood to write a long letter to Leah. I bless the rain. It is making a quagmire of the field, wetting our blankets and my feet are cold as ice. No reason why I should not spend the day with Leah as I promised myself I would. Rubin is inclined to write. We are as uncomfortable as we can be. Lie on stomach till it hurts, wiggle and squirm to find comfort. None to be had. Have occasion to go outside and see two dozen men drilling in the rain by way of atoning for absence at Reveille, squad leader among them for having a dirty gun on Saturday. Write until 12. Mess. Fine boiled beef, potatoes, tea, bread. Take off my shoes, socks, spread my blankets and settle myself for a nap. If drill call blows, let it blow. My feet warm up. I fall asleep. Wake to find my tent fallen in, everything wet. F Co. men moving into billets have pulled up a stake from soft earth, without stopping to repair the damage. Fix it. Go out for a bit of air. What will I do next? Another letter from Leah is given me. What now? A bombshell, work aplenty. Clean guns wanted. Rag and oil furnished for purpose. Small extra blanket rolls are to be made up. We move tonight in the rain. Someone is joking? I pay no attention. Do my writing. Supper is served. Bully beef, potatoes, coffee, bread. Ordered to strike tents. No shirking it now. Rubin is not around. He has gone for supper to the village. I make the best of it in his absence. Prepare my own pack first. He comes to help. In a few minutes we are once more homeless and at the mercy of someone else. Rubin has a piece of plum pie. Only that can make me feel cheerful. I go for water. I am caught for a detail to unload our blanket rolls at Batt. Hdqrs. and it is dark before I come back. Tobacco has been issued, 2 pkgs, 25 box cigarettes. Rubin has something better for me. Three more letters, one from Leah, two from Lottie. Everything is so wet and sticky, heavy. March off at 9:45. First lap made with ease. It is not so very dark, not raining hard. Road is fine. We see no opening in woods as we pass through. It is the force of our wills and from sheer ????? that opens the gates for us. The sky rises from the embankment just at the side of the road. Those dark, ghostlike forms in the distance are clumps of woods. Rest in the village of ............ . Men think it necessary to make a lot of noise to disturb the natives. A few look out of windows. March again into village of ............ . Rest outside a graveyard. Then out into the open for two laps. It is drizzling and so dark that I cannot see the movement of my feet, or my hand before my face. I do not know that there is anyone ahead of me. I must ask and watch till there is only a blur ahead of me. A fearful strain on the eyes. I shut my eyes. Push out my feet. I am fortunate they land safely. Put out my hand to touch Rubin, who marches besides me. Many times I drop far behind. Woe to the man who falls out to-night. He will not be found until morning. When we rest, I sit on my steel helmet, which I should have worn but I have troubles enough and I carry it in my hand. On we go through the darkness. I do not know what impels us, what guides us. Tramp, Tramp, Tramp. Song is sung. The man ahead stops, because ahead of him is a man who stops. His back almost touches my body before I am aware of motion ahead having stopped. Rain is so cold it almost freezes. Body so warm from exertion that every pore is open. A flash of light from an officer's lantern, a matter of consuming interest. Where is it and what else is there? Tired from broken pace, sleepy, I yawn while marching. Rest outside a hospital, many buildings in an enclosure. Off again. Houses, one, then two, then three stories. It must be a city. RR tracks. Guarded lights, pavements, shop windows. We are home once more. Inpatient because another company is billeted before we are. Almost to end of city till we stop. Smell horse, a big pile of brick before us. Sound of running water. Up an incline to floor above. Men asleep. Wake them as we move to bunks, with a bed pack on each. Undo packs, lie down on a damp bed, covered by a wet blanket, in wet clothes. Coffee comes. Never before has coffee tasted so good. I am asleep between the time my cup is taken away from me and the time it comes back filled. Dirt, dust, smell of horse and damp mud. A hard bed. If the women at home could have seen their boys tonight, would war continue? Men sleep on the floors too. A bolo issued to me. What will I do with it? I am not told. I wish I had never seen it.

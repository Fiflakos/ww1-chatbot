Check up ledger, bills, etc. Look over check book. Gratifying. Joe and Bertha com. Joe brings me a pair of leggings and Bertha makes a cake for me. Dinner in my honor. Mr. Braverman comes. Children come. Willie comes with things we had left at Mamas. The annoyance my leave taking tonight appears in us both. We are querulous. Leah makes preparations for my going. Washes my things. We go to Dollies. Stay for 20 minutes. Come back for supper. I take a nap until 11:30 while Leah packs my things. Apter downstairs. Leah is frightened and heartsick when she wakens me. I occupy her to divert her mind. Take a cup of tea and am on my way. Back to Camp, far away from my love. But I am glad that I leave Leah at home to cry and thankful, very thankful, for a three day holiday with Pudgie. Seems not so hard to bear her absence for a time. Apter goes with me to car. Deliver tirade on war and draft to ward off any boring advice, which I suspected his purpose to give. Make early boat, which is delayed. Get to station at 1:15. No train till 2. Schedule changed. On trip out, wakeful. Read, smoke. Am amused at efforts of others to fall asleep. Train cold, but I am comfortable, thanks to Leah. Train makes exceedingly fast trip. Arrive at barracks at 4:50 am. Bitter cold. Go to bed with clothes on. Say prayers, but do not sleep.

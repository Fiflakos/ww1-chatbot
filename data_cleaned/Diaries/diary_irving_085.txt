Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 9 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. May 9, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up late. Almost miss breakfast. No time to wash. Bacon, bread, coffee. Report for duty at Batt. Hdqrs. at 7:45. On way up meet Captain leading out company. I thought they had already left or I would have avoided him. He stops me to question what my duties for the day are. I tell him. He wants to know when I must report. I tell him 7:30. Looks at his watch. After time. Gives me a call. I make an excuse. Say between 7:30 and 8 will do. That appeases him. Still very much displeased that I am not with company. Enter office. Major and adjutant already there. Work for an hour. Become very thirsty. Necessary to go back to billet to get water bottle. Fill it at water cart. Drink my fill. Keep bottle with me. Stay at my figures until 11:45. My partner Fox not working well. His figures do not tally for some reason. Sets time for completion of job back considerably. On the other hand, I have found myself. No longer necessary for me to figure on paper. In most cases I do sums mentally. Mess. Beef stew, from fresh meat, with rice, coffee, bread. Go back to work at once. Major not around. Sgt. Major has an opportunity to take afternoon off. Fox does not show up until 2. I had begun to think he had tired of job. Tells me a story of a big dinner at officer's mess through the favor of a friend. I grow to dislike him more and more every minute. Tallon in charge of office. He runs out into next courtyard where battalion supplies are kept. Comes back with a big bunch of prunes, dates and a few oranges. We have a party with dates. Save a few for boys in billet after supper. Not much to do until Sgt. Major comes back. He starts things humming again. Called outside by an orderly who is on duty in yard. Previous to that we had heard a few shot reports apparently from air. What orderly shows us explains. Far up in the air are three airplanes. Shells are bursting near them. Sound can plainly be heard and puffs of smoke can be seen against blue of sky. Not sure whether objects are not observation balloons. Look up into sky so long that vision becomes blurred. Aircraft out of sight under a cloud bank. Firing at them continues. 4 airplanes flying in other direction, also at great height. We think it a party out to down craft which is being fired at though it is doubtful, account they are flying in other direction. When things are quiet, we go back into office. Work until 5:00. Go for mess. Bully beef, hard tack, coffee, marmalade. A straggling line. Boys have been to the shower baths. Come back one by one, pleased and feeling comfortable. At mess sound of explosion in air is heard, again from direction of front. After a time I discover puffs of smoke similar to those seen in early afternoon. No aircraft can be seen by me. Other men claim they can see them in clouds. A short engagement. Back in billet to write until 8:30. Look for Tallon. He is busily engaged at his typewriter. Officers have found occasion for dictation. Get matches in village. Back in the hay, read English newspapers 2 and 3 days old, until darkness falls. Make bed and get under blankets. Gossip for an hour. One of the men remarks that it takes a longer time for complete darkness to fall than it does in our country. I have wondered about that for a long while. Of course it might be taken into consideration that clock is set an hour ahead, yet it is light until almost 9:30. My night's rest broken and uncomfortable. I am tempted to get up a number of times. Guns are not very active. A few spurts of bombarding during the day. No air activity except for the incidents noted. They lead to the conclusion that there is a possibility of air attack during the night. Special precautions are taken about screening lights. Candle in our barn put out early. A regimental order to that effect. Another order is that no men or officers will be permitted to go to ........ Sunday. As usual a case where the few men make the many suffer. Brawling and misconduct on the part of men in our division who were in town Sunday. A blow to the men. Madam is to be congratulated today. A new calf is born in the night, which accounts for the unrest among the animals in the barnyard all through the night. Lt. Berry pays us a visit at Batt. Hdqrs. A memo received about lack of initiative among non-coms and junior officers. Unofficial British comment. Question Company Clerk about making out blank for additional allotment to Leah for Cecilie, bless her. Too late. His Majesty does not work after retreat, in France.

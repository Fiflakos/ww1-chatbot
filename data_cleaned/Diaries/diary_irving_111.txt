Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 4 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Jun. 4, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. A little later than rest of the men. Pleased to hear that I will mess with my new platoon. Will not have to see the disgusting spectacle of giving food grudgingly so that the giver may have more for himself. Unfortunately there is a very poor breakfast. Battalion must make an accounting to the British for rations on hand. They are short on coffee, bread and rice, beside other supplies which must be made up for before battalion moves. Result, no coffee, bread or milk for breakfast. A meager spoonful of rice, some bacon, a few pieces of hard tack. Complaints so loud that Captain orders tomorrow's bread ration to be eaten, taking a chance on being able to buy some for Wednesday's meals. I do not have to wait or beg. I am cheerfully given precedence on line when I mention that I must report for duty early. Boys are going through what appears to be their morning French lesson. There are four or five words they know which are being recited by all. One suggests another until they master quite a few. Some of them have dictionaries. In office at 7:30. Fox comes soon after. We get to work. Error which baffled me last night easily straightened out. Ask Sgt. to issue an order calling two Company Clerks to our aid. They come. I set them to work on their own company rolls. I arrange a sort of conversion table for them. They prove more adept at figures than I am. My figures are still twisted. B.... finishes well ahead of us. He assists Fox, who I was afraid would not do very well. In reality he is more accurate than I, though a trifle slower. His roll totaled up found correct by B.... . Other man finishes. Then both assist me. We are annoyed by the Gas period interrupting. Try ruse of shutting door again, with success. Unanimous opinion - it is too bad a job as it is without the inconvenience of wearing a respirator. Conversion of sums into francs is finished at 12 sharp, just in time to go to mess. Lend Pimpl, cook, 10 Frs., a move that pays dividends, if I care to take advantage of it. Dinner. Bread saved from breakfast, beef stew, lime juice. Plenty of it. I hear Captain asking Mess Sgt, what his suggestions are as to nature of supplies wanted. Company will purchase same. I can still find an afternoon's work to do at Hdqrs. on Co. E payroll, which is as usual incorrectly compiled. Many doubtful items in it. Must straighten out according to my own judgment. Lieut. in a number of times but makes no further mention of taking me with him. I wonder if Sweet was taken instead. Pump Sgt. Major. He is discreet in his answers. He will further my cause, I am sure, if opportunity presents itself. Trouble with additions again. I am either too excited or too fed up with figures to work properly. Work perseveringly until I straighten out the tangle. A number of very loud explosions are heard. They rock the building noticeably. Aeroplanes battling overhead. Our men reported up in squadrons. Work done at 4 o'clock, one hour later than my latest promise to Lt. Bugler Maurer comes to ask for E Co. rolls. A correction to be made that will affect the entire roll. Work ahead for tomorrow, I see. Haight has been to Rgt. Hdqrs. and has been informed of his many misstatements on rolls. They are identical with what I have told him. He was not satisfied to take me as an authority on the subject, but now my judgment on the matters in question is vindicated. I inform Lt. of the change. I promise to correct in the morning. I figure it will take an hour to make the change, then I will take the rest of the day to myself to do some washing, go for a bath and perhaps to town. I hear Lt. tip off Capt. G Co. of destination in coming movement. Will be surprise to men. American sector hinted at. Too good to be true. Nothing would please our men better. Supper, a feast compared to past ration. Cheese, bully beef, potato, jam, coffee, bread. Really more than I would eat ordinarily. Long empty stomach shown favor tonight, if it ever was. Fuss about at ration dump for about an hour, discussing payrolls with Sgt. Back to quarters to write until 8:30. Set up our tent. It has been taken down by Reagan. It was necessary for him to do so to make up a big pack, with full equipment, which was carried today by all men who were out on drill. Get a bucket of water in which I take a refreshing bath before going to bed. I must refill bucket for man from whom I borrowed it in order to have use of it again when I want it. Make my bed and go to bed at dusk. Reagan comes in a little later. A little chat before I fall asleep, on general topics. Tell him latest report of probable destination. Sleep very well. Fritz and Tommy are at it hammer and tongs after sundown. There is no cessation of the fight while I am awake. Frequent shelling in air mingled with rattling fire of machine guns. One big gun pounds steadily. Men are making usual cleanup of chickens similar to foray they made at last billet, when departure was imminent. Groups behind billet roasting them. Every few minutes a shot is heard. A chicken has gone west. All very well, and to my mind a just reprisal for having to pay one and a half Frs. for a bar of chocolate and 9 cents for an orange, but townspeople have the upper hand in the game just the same. They report to the town major who exacts a fine from companies, which each man must pay a share of. Even I will have to pay for chicken other men ate. Unfair and futile. Boys in SOS class have had an easy morning shooting on small range we built a few days ago. A moving target is used. Shooting in the nature of a competition to determine men qualified for marksmen. Their afternoon session is spent in same manner. I meet most of the boys during the day. They are anxious to have me back in class. Zimmerman, who was dismissed once before, is back again in the good graces of the Lt. once more. He replaces another man.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 8 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. Jun. 8, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good On Hike. .... Kilometres to ........ Up at 5:45, Breakfast. Stewed figs, bread, coffee, marmalade from one of the boys. I save some and all of my bread. Have walked around and stood on line in my bare feet, altogether for over an hour. Not much dew on the ground, but it is excellent for cooling my tired feet. We must be off at 7:00. Packs rolled. Tents struck. Policing as usual. With packs, it is again a case of slicker in, slicker out, because it looks like rain. Otherwise, off without much fuss. Sun comes out strong and hot. Blouses are not worn, but I sweat a great deal. Road itself very hot and dusty, though excellent. Walk 30 minute periods, rest 10. Pack does not bother me at all. I am becoming used to weight of it. Two pads under shoulder straps to prevent cutting. Water obtained from well in courtyard of house opposite campsite before leaving. When that is gone, we must obtain fresh supply from water carts. Carts have water that is so impure, that 3 scoops of chloride are necessary to purify 100 gals. It is nasty tasting stuff, which even I, who insist that boys drink it instead of well water, balk when it comes to drinking it. More like medicine than water. Pass through a number of small villages. For two stretches, I carry an extra gun. Once Himpler's then Rubin's, not so much extra work or weight that I can notice, but it tells on me, so that during third period of march I have all I can do to carry my own. My feet are burning as if coals were in my shoes. Toes and heels hurt. Perhaps it is the heat of the road. Meet a body of our men coming from a different direction. All our officers at the crossroads. Pass two streams, which are extremely inviting. Near twelve, we enter ......... . Supplies there waiting. A smart little place, with a market square, two big watering pools, a large chateau and an imposing church. Looks like an ideal place for a stop, but looks are deceiving. No definite arrangements made for tenting or billeting. We go to edge of village and beyond into orchard. Take off our packs and told to stay. Mess will be ready in three quarters of an hour. Must not meander off bounds. Officers go for a pow-wow to see if we can have use of place for pitching tents. In the meantime I take off my shoes and socks and look about for water with which to bathe and cool my feet. An hospitable old woman gives me some in a leaky basin. An immediate relief. Soak my feet for half an hour. Men all over begging for eggs and wine. Everything is scarce, most of all water. We are not even permitted to boil the water which is to be had. Dinner. Boiled, beef, potato, onion, bread, but nothing to drink. Line juice is promised as soon as water can be obtained. Word comes that we can use orchard provided we no not climb or cut trees. Formed for pitching tents. Pair up with Rubin. Pitch and arrange our tent amid cow dung which is most plentiful. Take off my shoes and begin to write, but fall asleep. Nap till 3:30. Rubin comes in to write. I make another attempt to do so. His diary is in Hebrew. It excites my interest and I make him read me a page of it. It is a literary gem. Instead of writing, we converse and discuss the relative merits of his and my methods of noting our experiences. A friend comes to take him away. I resume my writing until mess call blows. I would relish a good meal. Beef stew, bread, tea. The tea is made from water which is so much chlorinated that it drowns the taste of the tea altogether. I an compelled to quench my thirst with a glass of beer that tastes like dishwater. Quite a time getting it. Continue writing until dark. Receive two letters from Leah. Good news, Thank God. Disappointed that I get so few letters. None from Mama and wonder whether any of my letters have reached home. No mention made of water to bathe my feet and for canteen. Draw from well pump in courtyard of Chateau. An uninteresting exterior to house, but interior bespeaks riches, good taste and art. Grounds well taken care of and ample. A summer house and another building to be seen. I make an attempt to walk through park. Lt. comes in. Looks questioningly at me. Ask permission to promenade. Refused. Make up my mind to return tomorrow morning. I must go opposite road for drinking water. Pass kitchen on way. Inquire of cooks if they have orders to move tomorrow. They have not, but while I am there Haight comes to tell them that tomorrow at 9 AM we must be off account of lack of good water. Water obtained after much trouble is so heavily dosed that it might as well have been pure chlorine. Wash and bathe. Return to chateau to refill bucket for Dougherty from whom I borrowed it. At crossroads are two regular army engineers enroute for their camp on motorcycles. A group around them. Treated to drink by our boys and to repay tell of their experiences in France. Tell us our training schedule will probably be a long one. Go to bed at 10. It is misty and cold. Do not sleep well. Worried because there is no opportunity to write Leah. I would have done so under any circumstances if there were any chance of mailing a letter. Out of earshot range of front. Strange that after so long a time under the guns we should be going away from them. Airplanes are only evidence of activity. Aerodrome within a stones throw of us accounts for that. Up in flocks of thirty or more. Different type of machine than near other front and nearly all scout planes. Conduct of our men is disgraceful. From the beginning of the hike, where the drinking bout started, they have been drunk continuously. Wine is procured against all regulations and in spite of restrictions placed upon sale by inhabitants. Irishmen have formed a clique and have cornered the liquor market. Almost get into a scrap with woman in estaminet. No chocolate, cigarettes or sweets of any kind can be procured. One of our men arrested for buying champagne. Taken away from him and drunk by British MP who caught him, whereupon he is released.

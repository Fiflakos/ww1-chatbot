Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 10 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. Jun. 10, 1918 Weather: Raining, Mild Health: Good Up at 8:00. Find that men have stolen a bale of hay at a stop we have made while I was asleep. Has my approval. Sufficient to make a soft bedding for entire car. It begins to rain. I lie down again for another hour's nap. Raining heavily. To add to our discomfort, we find that the roof of the car leaks like a sieve. Only way to remedy it is to stretch our shelter halves across top beams of car. Rain comes in, in spite of all in some corners of car, especially in mine. Tin helmet for a pillow. I am up again at 9. Almost everyone else is, so we decide to have breakfast. Bread, jam, cheese from last night's supper ration. Wall and Devanny take a swig of Jamaican rum, for an appetizer. It is such strong stuff that, seasoned drinkers though they are, it makes them squirm. These are only men in our car who are drinking. Rest are all sober. But in car next to ours every man but one is lying dead drunk. No one awake yet. Other cars have similar reports to make. I remain awake. Pick a choice seat on car floor by car door for observation. Feet dangle outside. Airy and pleasant. Only complaint is due to the rain. Somehow when we travel it rains. Villages and towns of considerable size along the road. Only one evidence of destruction in a factory city of the first class. Deserted, and most of the roofs caved in, windows broken, walls down. Scenery a constant source of surprise and wonder. Streams and woods more plentiful. Wheat grain fields less to be seen than garden truck farms. Wild poppies everywhere. Hillsides cultivated and laid out in fields which resemble crazy quilts. Some remind me of shaven poodle dogs with a tuft of trees to relieve the smooth green of the lawns. Houses more solid in construction. Brick has replaced wood and plaster. Design much more modern. A few army camps of British seen, but as we go along they are more frequently occupied by Frenchmen. Stop frequently for water at stations. Coffee served from our cookers. Still using highly chlorinated water. Warmth it gives is welcome. Nothing prevents our men from buying wine, even at 2 minute stops. They manage to get some from stationmen or by bribing children to run into town to get it for them. Pay fabulous sums for the stuff. At two, we stop at ......... for twenty minutes. We are given coffee with rum at a French cooking station. I give mine away. Run into town to buy some chocolate. 1st Battalion has been here ahead of us and has cleaned out the town. Can get two raw eggs to supplement our dinner of veal and hardtack. Buildings lack care and paint on the outside. Shops beautiful, neat and well-stocked. Much wine bought. Caught in a heavy shower and before I can get back to car I am well drenched. Train starts. A wild scramble to get aboard in which some men are nearly left. An opportunity to wash in brook, which flows parallel to track. Move slowly along through a rich countryside. Fruit becomes evident. At sight of ripe cherries boys go wild. Want to hop off train to pick some. A stop made, where black coffee is served from our cookers, another where we get coffee, soup, army's water. Maloy still asleep. Since after breakfast. He has not taken any food since then. Admits he is not feeling well, then protests he is all right. I fear he is very ill. I feel his head. He has high temperature. Tell company clerk to procure a doctor. Get Maloy up and give him some pills. Goes back to sleep again until next morning. People along road wave a greeting to us, throw us flowers and wish us good luck. Boys shout and whistle all day. Supper. Bully beef, hard tack, good coffee with rich milk at ......... . Large French camp and aviation field at .......... Rivers passed. Concrete ships being built at one. Rain stops before sundown. Can see .......... in the distance. A long stop at .......... to change engines and switch to a track going different direction. Given a great welcome here. Frenchmen, here and all along route, beg us to give them tobacco. None can be had in towns. Soldiers and well dressed citizens get what little we can spare. Children and women Red Cross workers collect cigarettes, tobacco, and money to buy same for soldiers. Beauty of this part of country beyond description. It holds my interest to such an extent, I cannot tear myself away from the door. Stay there till long after dark. It is cold but I stay awake to see what I can. I would have remained all night were it not for men asking to have door closed. Electric trains, American built engines and railroad passed. Bridges, viaducts and factories of familiar design. American soldiers and officers in small numbers to tell us where we are and give us welcome. They accept liquor and tobacco from our boys. A beautiful sunset. Not a gun heard or an airplane seen in flight. This is nothing but a pleasure trip. Go to sleep, or rather try to, sitting up against our door, then lie down. Draft from cracks makes me move closer to walls for warmth. Change to other side, between two men. Still cold and uncomfortable and at 2, I must get up and undo my pack and get out blankets. Fall asleep at about three. At ......... refugee children and women.

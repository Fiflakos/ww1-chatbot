Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 17th November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 17th. Friday. Day in Amiens. Centigrade 6 points.It was very bleak and cold at 7 a.m. I got toHarry Dingle by 8 o'clock and by a big motor waggon we wentrumbling along the Albert-Amiens straight tree-lined road,getting into the city before 11 a.m. A haircut and shaveand a good hot bath, 1 franc & , gave us a better appetitefor dinner than the best dinner we really could find. Verydisappointing indeed. It took us until 5 o'clock to shop.I bought a cap, 20 francs; putties 15 francs; leather buttons2 francs; cigarette case, metal, 2 francs; soap box, toothbrushes, tooth powder 9 francs. Dingle did more shoppingthan I.We had a gin and vermouth before looking out fordinner, in the American Bar. The dining room was closed atthe Savoy (officers only). The Tommy traffic man, who neverhad a square meal in his life (as his judgment proved)directed us to a place. We wanted a full course dinner.At 3 o'clock we went into a place and had a whole lobster - 16 -between us with a small bottle of beer, and bread and butter;14 francs. 4 francs in London and Sydney. Later twowhiskeys cost 2 francs and the waiter battled hard for histip. Now we can buy whiskey at 4 and 5 francs a bottle soyou can guess I felt hurt!! I bought 5 bottles of whiskeyfor the fellows at Longueval. We visited some rather finecafes which were all full up with French soldiers and officers;a few women were there, but very few indeed.The Cathedral is a splendid monument. The architectureis very handsome but the building material is of poorquality, and taking it all around I was very disappointed indeed.We were home at 10 o'clock, left Amiens 8 p.m.(23 kilos).

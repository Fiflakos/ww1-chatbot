Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 26 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sun. May 26, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Mild Health: Good Up at 6:00. Wash. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Police around tent. Pick up white clothes and hide in bush. Cut fresh branches from bushes to camouflage tent. Put my house in order. Everything within folded in good order. Ready for Major and Colonel. Lts. have come back. They were up and out before 5. I stir a wash in can over hot fire till water boils. Sgt. Fisher picks me of all men to go out towards road to watch for Colonel's party. I demur, but finally I have to go. Take my post taking advantage of opportunity to read remainder of letters I received yesterday. Every one, thank God, contains good news. Leah and baby well. In a few minutes Lts. relieve me. I go on with my washing. Hot water too hot. Chat with boys on bench until it cools sufficiently. Cloudy till now. Sun steals out for a little while. Finish work. Take clothes to farm house to rinse in cold water. Bring back a can of water for Himpler. Hang clothes to dry. Carefully conceal white clothes in bushes. Work for day is done. I begin a letter to Leah. Write on bench for a time, then get into tent. Mess is ready at 12 sharp. Beef stew, hard tack, coffee. Lieut. comes back. Gives men who remained in camp yesterday permission to go to their company headquarters. I did not intend to go because I do not fancy long hike. Men start for town before I have my letter completed so when ready, I must go to town myself to mail letters. Start at two. Get whatever letters men have ready to mail. Follow same road used by us in coming in last Wednesday. Walk until I reach spot opposite cemetery where we stopped on Wednesday. I am on wrong road but I am not aware of it. while I rest seated on spreading trunk of tree, I write two pages of a letter to Mama. Let a good opportunity to ride pass by. Walk on. Meet a Frenchman. Pass the time of day. He offers me a cigarette. Unusual generosity for a poor Frenchman. As a rule they ask for largesse. Cut short his voluble lamentations about devastation of la belle France. Go on until I see a signpost which assures me I am on the wrong road. I had suspected as much. Objects I pass are unfamiliar. Lose a half hour in retracing my footsteps. At right crossroads, a Canadian in a car halts to inquire direction to town he wishes to make. It is in my direction. He offers me a ride. We converse. He is from Missouri. Swap stories of experiences. Outside of my old billets door in a few minutes. Stop for ten minutes to finish conversation. Everybody at home. I am quite welcome. Finish Mamas letter after we have told each other news. Mess is ready. Still working by platoon system. A tin of bully beef to each two men, cheese, bread, onions fried, hard tack, coffee. Can get more if I wish. Borrowed mess kit. Go to orderly room. Meet other men in from school. Agree to meet on way back. Lt. Cook in orderly room. He limps. I ask him why. Sprained his ankle at front. Communicative. Buy chocolate. Meet Captain and Lt. First platoon in quarantine. Ginsberg is very ill. He is taken to hospital. Get tobacco ration. Deliver mail to Company F and H. Wait at crossroads for men going back. It develops they have made same mistake as I on trip in. I do not admit my guilt. I kid them. Start back at 7 on right road with three others. Rest at cemetery. From there we get a lift in a lorry to road leading to home. There are two roads. Gilard on post tells us the road to left is a short cut. We take it and as usual when following the advice of others we lose our way. See ammunition trains going up line. Anti-air gun in field with operator watching. Shell holes which seem to be lately made. Am a trifle nervous. Missiles are heard to whiz in the distance. Find YMCA hut. Get paper and envelopes. Locate a shower bath. Ask our way. Am properly directed. Home shortly much relieved. Very tired from hike. Make bed. Poker game among boys does not interest. No news. Undress and go to bed. Fall asleep quickly and sleep fairly well in spite of noise of engagement. Today the guns have net been idle for a minute and at night a barrage is put over apparently by us, which is terrible to listen to. A constant rumbling, not as lead as isolated shots. It ceased far an hour during night, according to guard, but is renewed and kept up until morning. Airmen are up, but I am not aware of any casualties or engagements. 0ne, I observe, pitches headlong to earth, or I thought he was winged, but he rights himself. Very cold and misty during the night but I sleep well in spite of it. Say my prayers with special fervor.

Author: Irving Greenwald: Date: 30 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tuesday April 30, 1918 Weather: Rain, Cloudy, Cold Health: Good, leg sore The hardest day's work since I am in the army Up at 6:00. Reveille. Go up for breakfast with blouses on. While we wait on line it begins to rain drearily. Too far from billets to go back for raincoats. Get thoroughly wet. Try to find shelter under coping of barn. But drip from eaves is as much as from rain. Lets up sufficiently for us to get our mess of bread, butter, marmalade and coffee without milk. Very little for the day's work ahead of us. Lie down for half an hour. Clean gun a bit. Out for drill at 7:50 with slickers. Mud everywhere. Leg causing me pain. Tired before we get to courtyard for assembly. Difficulty in climbing hill. Captain leads company off to drill field without a halt. Wet through from exertion. Start off with patrol work up and down road for an hour with no purpose that I am aware of. Lieut. makes an effort to explain but captains order "forward march" interrupts. On drill field after company is assembled. Allowed to fall out for ten minutes. Close order drill for another hour. Platoon leaders give us manual of arms. Another rest of ten minutes. Company moves off again in direction of home but pass our road. Push on and go past detention camp and drill f1e1d to rifle range, up an embankment which taxes my strength to the utmost. A rest of ten minutes. Squad out for instruction in Lewis machine gun. Method of loading shown us. Assembled and marched home by a short cut. Pleased at prospect of getting back a little early, grow more tired owing to condition of road, up hill and down, through deep mud. In billets at l2:30, almost too tired to eat though I an very hungry. Wet through from perspiration. Dinner. Hard tack and beef stew, tinned. Get a second helping, enough to satisfy me. Rest in straw after mess. Fall asleep for ten minutes. Like going to execution to go up to courtyard for assembly. Captain stays in quarters. Lts. take us to drill field beyond detention camp. Make the biggest effort of my life to get there. Tempted to fall out. Grit my teeth and go on. Officers tired too. They know men are too tired to work and do not push us at all. Permitted to rest for 25 minutes. Revives me for a time. Cross road for open order drill. Corporals drill squads. Callahan takes us to far end of field where we fake it. Aiming and firing from prone positions. Restful work for a short time. Go back much better for short rest. Change slickers for overcoats to attend muster. Sgt. Corras appears in formation drunk. Captain much annoyed by his remarks but feigns not to notice him. Pigs run about yard interfering with business, causing laughter. Wait for retreat. Dismissed for day. Thoroughly fagged out and disgusted. Write until mess call blows. Supper. Bully beef, bread, coffee, not enough. I write until eight. Decide to look for something to eat. Go to village for some chocolate. None in town except for small pieces for which they ask too high a price which I will not pay. Meet our cook who tells me of a canteen, a mile and a half distant where things can be had cheap. We make for it together until we meet a man on road who tells us canteen closes at 8. Go back to billet, hungry. Almost lose my way in the dark. Reilly, bunkmate, has not made up our bed. No candles. Make a mess of job in the dark. Cannot sleep, too tired, for an hour and a half. Then blankets become twisted and cannot be righted. Get up three or four times to straighten them. Unsuccessful. Cold all night. In the morning, while resting, I think of my wedding day and whether Leah looks at my clothes hanging in the closet and wonders when I will be back to wear them. Not much to be heard from the battle front. Only a few deposits heard. A great many horses come from front going in direction of railroad. A motor truck with a damaged aeroplane is seen. Plane has broken propeller and twisted wheels showing every indication of a serious accident. Activity in the air confined to a few hours in the afternoon. Single planes go over flying very low. From height above rifle range new towns are seen. In one an anti-aircraft gun is plainly seen mounted on top of tallest building. Many complaints about short rations made to officers. We learn from British they are fed same as us. They do not work as hard and can do with less food.

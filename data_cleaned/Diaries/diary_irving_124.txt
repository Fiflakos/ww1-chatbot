Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 18 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. Jun. 18, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Hike 17 kilometres to ......... . Hike 14 kilometres to ........... . Voices from New York Out of bunk at 8:00. I have not slept. It was the hard and damp. A piece of bread with butter and coffee for breakfast. We are in an old brick factory. Another organization quartered with us. A gas tank to the rear, fields in front and to the left. City to right. We are an the outskirts. A cold clear brook running against the wall on side of road. Straighten out my equipment, which I threw anywhere to get to bed in a hurry. Wash, shave and brush up a bit until I feel much refreshed. Ask again for my blanket roll. Cooks preparing for dinner. Perhaps I can get to where it is supposed to be before we move again. I will try. Off through the city. Shops of all kinds, factories, a department store, jeweler, printer, butchers. Our soldiers have possession of the town. Fine hotels, a wide street, narrow side streets. Meet Rubin. Commission him to buy me socks and shoes, hats. Out of town on main road. Ask directions of Frenchmen to make sure of fast pace. Pass our resting place of last night. It is a hospital. Wounded are coming in. What we thought beautiful last night is ramshackle and vice-versa. I am sure I will get a lift. What beautiful country we passed through last night without knowing it. I would have liked to march now in the sunlight. Make ........... in an hour and a quarter. Ask every soldier in town for my blanket roll. See Sgt. Corras. Sweet, whom I locate in Rgt. Hdqrs. office, tells me packs were picked up and taken away last night. A hard pill to swallow. A fair sized village. Back at once. Do not let disappointment detain me. I must go back to quarters for mess. Again no lift. Men are just messing. Fine boiled beef, potatoes, bread, tomato beef broth. A long time since we have had soup. I am exhausted when I lie down to rest after dinner. Take my shoes off. Too tired to sleep, I toss about until 3. Up. On with my shoes. Armed with a towel, downstairs to brook to bathe my feet. Cold as ice. Feet tingle. A blister between toes hurts and bleeds. Much refreshed nevertheless. Wash a towel and some handkerchiefs. I have another important mission to perform. I must keep a promise to Leah and buy a wedding ring. A heavy rain and hail shower comes up. Detains me only a few minutes. Mail a letter to Leah. Visit YMCA. Want to look into print shops, but doors are locked. Buy a map. Stuff up with sweets. Pry into every shop window. Last of all into the town jeweler's. It is easy to ask for what I want. Jeweler himself wears one but he has none in stock. Another disappointment. Moves for our men at YMCA at 3 and 7. Behave wonderfully. An open town. But no one spoils a good record for sobriety for the day. Confine themselves to purchases of sweets and caps, leggings, etc. Shopkeepers reaping a harvest on high prices. Back to bed for another rest. Up for supper. Beef stew, bread, coffee. Lie down again until 7. Make my pack. Chat with 1st. Sgt. of Signal Corps. Told and shown a map where we are going, by good authority. Write until order to fall in comes. I have prayed all day that orders might be changed. A few absentees at formation. Off for end of village to wait remainder of battalion. A beautiful sight. Cool, sun is setting. Flowers given to us by three young ladies, who hang over a wall. I fall out to get one. Reprimanded by Lt. C., so Lt. W. gets one for me. Men all in fine spirits. Sing songs full of cheer. Moon comes up bright and clear. A wonderful wine coloured sunset. Road leads through woods most of the way. Moon shines directly on paths. It is as bright as day almost. At last I have managed well. The ..-th comes along, back from the line, to rest. An ovation. They retard our progress. It does not matter. Hello Mac, Hello Bill. Anyone from Harlem, Yorkville, Brooklyn? The Dutchman is easy! Fritz will end your vacation! Songs. Alabama boys halt us. ......... destroyed and in ruins from shell fire. Southern men, a little heated with wine, back to rest, entertain us. "Fritz is afraid. Show them up as we did." More of our boys. The ..th is strong in numbers and spirit. Great hulking fellows. Getting tired. Pack a burden. Marching difficult for two columns of troops on a narrow road mostly through woods. We lose a lot of time halting to let them pass. Rest in one place where there is a ditch by roadside, which I do not notice. I sit down and fall backwards almost going down entirely, losing my helmet. I am calmer than those who observe me. Very painful walking after resting. Heels and toes blistered. Were it not for the beauty of the evening and the sight of some of our boys, I do not know what misery I would have suffered. Our home looms up. Wind lets us know when we are near. Brings with it odor of horses and musty breath of old things in town. Partly destroyed by shelling. To right a large church, unharmed. To left, across road, ruins. Billeting and hoisting halt parade for a quarter of an hour while we sit on cold stones of pavement. Some men up and out to greet us. Wind our way through streets to end of town, into a gateway in grounds of ......... . A classic pile. Find our bunks of straw, mat and board in the dark. Sky light shows in the East. It is 2:30. Coffee brought to us. I find a sweater. Off with wet coat, roll into blanket and tent half. Fall asleep until awakened by pain in shoulder and hips from hardness of bed, and so on. Resigned to what is to come. Hope for the best. I face knowledge that on the 27th, I shall either be in the trenches or no more without a shudder.

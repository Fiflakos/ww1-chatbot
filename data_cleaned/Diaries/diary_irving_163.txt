Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 27 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Jul. 27, 1918 Weather: Raining, Mild Health: Good Capt. Mills dies two hours after he arrives in hospital Up at 7:00. It is raining. Prospects of going to ........ not very bright. Reluctant about going to breakfast, but, as no one will bring it to me, I must go for it myself. Rice and prunes, of which I can never get enough, bread and syrup, coffee. Wash and go back to bed for a few minutes. Wonder what to do about packages I want to send home. I enclose 1 piece of lace each, in five tobacco cans and go up to Lt. Griffiths quarters to wrap them up. He is pleased to see me and begins making out a pass for me, before I have anything to say. I was thinking if to-morrow would not be just as well to ask for a pass on account of the rain. Then, by thinking that even if I start at 1, I will have time to do my errands. I take the pass and tell Lt. that I will go as soon as it clears. He wants me to get for him a suit uniform, which may be ready, waiting for him at the officer's club, or the pharmacy. Also a pair of boots, which he is having repaired in ........ . Gives me money and OKs package I have ready and puts his signature on the wrappers I am to use for others. Leaves with Lt. K(?). I remain in his quarters for an hour wrapping and addressing packages. Sun comes out for a few minutes now and then, but afterwards it rains worse. Look for mail clerk to stamp packages with regimental censor stamp. That takes an interminably long time. One package not OK and he will not stamp it. I look for an officer to put his signature on it. Pass and repass Lt. Kiefer without noticing him. Finally look close and see him. He is glad to accommodate me. All set now. Lt. Cooke and Major being shown by Tedisco how accident in which 243Capt. Mills lost his life, occurred. Cooke looks important. Go back to quarters with my packages. Decide that in any case I will wait until after mess before I go to ........ . It rains and stops. Write until mess in my bunk. Mess. Bacon, stewed corn, bread, coffee. I am hungry immediately after. Take commissions from the boys, who want things from ........ . Gillece and Conway are going to Company Hdqrs. at ........ . Gives me the courage to start out. Get my packages and slickers in addition to my other equipment and I am on my way by a new road to ........ . It looks like more rain at any moment. Windy. A beautiful scene from the plateau. Miles of the surrounding country can be seen. Ripe grain and crops going to waste, because of a shortage of farm labor. In the YMCA trying to buy some crackers or anything that can be eaten. All out of things. Try Salvation Army next door. Get candy and cake. It rains heavily. Looks for a time like a continuous downpour. It stops in half an hour. The sky clears and again my plans change. Instead of remaining at the YMCA to write, I try to go on to ......... . A truck outside of Salvation Army loading officer's baggage. I ask if they go to my destination. Yes. They start soon. I get on. See O Co. boys, 166th on the road in camp between ........ and ........ . Lieut. Otto gets on the lorry with an orderly. He thinks I am one of the new boys, so he questions me. On finding I am one of Griffiths' men, the conversation is cut short. He gets off at ........ . We go on and I am deposited just outside of the ........ barracks. Raining again. In the Post Office I am disappointed to hear that there are no stamps. I have a few and am determined not to go back with the packages. I go among the men in the barracks and locate a man who has enough for my needs. I give him 2 Frs. for 27c worth. Glad that it is done. Next go to the Christaux to pay the 5 Frs. I owe. Proprietor is most surprised. He does not remember that I owe him money or who I am. Woman knows me. Men in town are new men. Not the same as when I was there Thursday. Go to drug store for Lt.'s uniform. He does not know anything about it. I go to the officer's club. There I hear that the tailor has been there up to three o'clock. Look for the interpreter that transacts business for him at the French Mission. He is not there, I find, after a long confab with everybody in the place. He will return soon I am told. I promise to come back in half an hour. Ask to have him held till my return. Go to photographer for Kirchner, find him closed. I am getting hungry, but I have no money except for a fr.'s worth of nuts. To buy handkerchiefs for the boys next. Shop well. Ask for the French Post Office. Must cross the bridge and see our boys fishing for trout. After a little difficulty, I find the PO and change McCleary's money order, giving the girl two nuts as a tip. She is tickled to death. Look at my watch. See it is late. Hurry back to the mission. Find interpreter is in and learn that the Lt. has to wait until Thursday before he can get his suit, unless he sends for it to Nancy. Hate to go back with disappointing news to Lt., so I try druggist again. Nothing has been left for me. Start for home. Just miss a ride to the next town and I must walk all the way in the rain. The same beautiful scenery not spoiled by the rain. To the YMCA to inquire for something for Farrell. Look for the old lady cobbler who has Griffiths' shoes. It seems he had given me the wrong address. Much fun trying to explain to the good folks what I want. Decide to ask soldiers. One of the boys knows where an old lady, who cobbles, lives. It is at other end of town. I go there, because it is on my way home. Ask Barney whom I meet. He also knows the cobbleress. At an ambulance Co.'s kitchen across the road from the shoemakers, I ask for some bread to take the edge off my hunger. It is cut for me, while I bargain with the woman (the 244cobbleress). She wants 13 Frs. for a poor job. She gives me change, while I listen for a motor truck to come along. I hear one just in time. I run across the road to get my bread and signal to the driver to slow down. He pays no heed to me. I run, but cannot catch his truck. Go back to the kitchen to swear and wait for another conveyance. I refuse to walk. I am too tired. Presently a prairie wagon comes along. I get a lift as far as the village. It rains and I loan the driver of the lumber my slicker. On the road I pass the new boys, on the street, some hiking, and some in camp at Mess. Walk into ........ with some of the new fellows. They have come directly from ........ without any previous training with the British. Their packs are three times the size of ours, but in spite of the weather and the weight of the packs, they utter not a complaint. A fine big lot of fellows, N.G's. In ........ I am greeted by the boys again. Some of them have not seen me since my return from the lines and accord me the same reception as everyone else has. I burst in on the cooks and demand something to eat. Sugarman gives me hot coffee and bread with jam. Welcome warmth in the coffee. Stay there and talk until it is very dark. No possibility of getting back to the billets in time to come within the time allowed me by my pass. That does not bother me. It is dark as pitch in the woods, I know. I look at my pistol. It is not even loaded. I hate the damned thing anyhow, so I will not bother to load now. Take the open road outside the wood as long as I can. Pass a Frenchman, a ghost out of the darkness. We greet each other to make sure we are friends. A barrage going on from our lines at my left. Think I am out of luck that tonight should be chosen for a fight, after so many nights of quiet. I am frightened by bushes, which stand along like sentinels. Stride into the woods. Inky black. I laugh and am amused at thought of what my Leah would say if she could see me now. For her approval, I will go through the darkness of the woods to my quarters. An almost hopeless and a somewhat dangerous job ahead of me. In I go floundering in mud. The boots hamper my movement. I can see eight dim figures crossing my path. It is the relief coming in. I am glad to meet up with them. I stay with them. At the first crossroad, we meet another platoon crossing our road. We stop. I insist I am right. Ask for an officer. None present. We go on. I am finding my way by my sense of direction. Go on until the column ahead stops. Cannot see a soul. They whistle to keep in touch with each other. A strange meeting with Kelly in the darkness. I help guide a company of engineers. Run into a man every step I take. At a crossroad I go right up hill, see lights. Find railroad track. Pat myself on the back for achievement. Follow track, making noise to attract attention of guard. I am passed. Meet Paul and lead him to our billet. Boys glad to see me. Wet. It is raining again. After I have told my story, I go to bed. Scratch all night. I do not sleep well. Tallon bothers me a lot. New men are greeted with the sound of action. Guns in the woods close to them must give them an exaggerated impression of the activity in these parts. M Guns, bombing etc. I pity them, too, for the task that confronts them. Pitching tents in the dark and rain.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 27 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. Jun. 27, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good My First Wedding Anniversary Up at 6:00. Stand on guard for 10 minutes or so. Corporal calls it off then. It is cloudy. Perhaps it may rain. Pick a handful of strawberries. Go to visit the new men. Sgt. 188Hesaber running around loose. We help him out of his troubles. Breakfast detail has gone down for mess. I lie down for a nap and a chat with Rubin. Men are all standing to, in trench. Stay until ordered out by 1st Sgt. Move back to woods, taking with us belongings of men who are on mess detail. Waiting anxiously for breakfast is too tame for me. I get out on road to look for cherries. See a farmer mowing hay in a field under a loaded tree. I approach with a smile, looking up at the tree inquiringly. Yes, cherries, but no good, "Sour, acid" and I can take all I wish. He has no use for them. I may take as many as I like. They are big and ripe. He takes out some tobacco to bite off, sufficient for a chew, telling me it is American tobacco. I play politics, giving him a plug I have been carrying around with me. He helps me half fill my hat with cherries. Breakfast. Apples, stewed, beans, doughnuts, bread, coffee. Full to excess. I want more cherries. Del Duca knows where to get some. He orders me back with mess kits, while he gets cherries big as plums. He promises to return with a capful. Move into back woods, Rubin helping me carry excess load. Lie down for a nap till Corporal comes back with cherries. Really good. He also brings back a fifty franc note, which he divides among the men, five francs each if they wish. I go to P..... to spend some of it, to wash and shave. Write out an order that Corporal authorizes me to purchase supplies for squad, go with Rubin to make purchases of crackers, cigarettes, jam, etc. Meet a Frenchman who has been in New York. He speaks almost perfect English. Modestly admits he knows a little. Gas shell holes all around our camp. Craters show evidences of potency of gas, earth being blackened and hardened in spots. Many of them, especially near batteries. Back after I make my toilet at the town pump. In ten minutes crackers are gone. It is time to go up for dinner. I do not care to go. Ask Rubin to bring me back a bit, if it is good. Lie down to read. What a Godsend is today, my wedding anniversary, and nothing to do but to bask in the sun, which has come out, and ponder upon my happiness in Leah. No trenches in sight. I am free from the guilt of having slain or even attempted to. I will write a letter to Leah to celebrate this day. If I would only get mail as a present it would be ideal. Maloy and Himpler come back while I read. They have met an orderly coming to us with a message. We are to pack up and move to the line with Lt. G. I am dazed. Ask a lot of questions to make sure that I am in my senses and have heard. Up my boy! Do not show these men you do not want to go. I pack up hurriedly for we are late. Cool as a cucumber, I will take my chances. Off for Batt. Hdqrs. Stop to have dinner. Steak, potato, bread, coffee. Rubin is troubled and pale. He knows. Eat quickly and little. We are off across field. They have sent orderly to look for us. It is all uphill. I begin to perspire. Never was I so hot. Anxious to get to Hdqrs. Men will not stop long enough to give themselves benefit of rest. In the woods are twenty or more men resting. We join them. Meet Sgt. Nichols, who tells us there is only a few hundred yards to go. Hdqrs. a beautiful barrack colony in woods. Men who built it have pavilions and enclosures. Lt. G. and other Battalion Lieuts. are there, but we will not go forward tonight. Orders have been rescinded. 4 men will go to-morrow at 8 AM. Gillece and I will wait till company goes up line. In meantime to return to posts. My prayers are answered. I am not reluctant about going back after I cool off. It is made in half time of trip up. Back in quarters in woods. Throw off pack in assumed disgust. Take off shoes. Prepare to write to Leah. Send Rubin for supper of beef stew, bread, butter and coffee, while I write, and after eating continue. As I lie I tell corporal of Lt. C.'s dissatisfaction with sector assigned to us when we go to line, 189that when C. and Iowans suffered many casualties, boys annoyed at Lt. Any place as good as another he holds. I defend the Lt., which angers the Corporal. He takes revolver, and points at me. I know he jests, so I do not move. Bang! I hear no bullet whizzing. He has shot, which I did not expect. Had I, I would have moved and been dead. I laugh at my narrow escape and go on writing. Lenehan is waiting, talking to Gillece. Maguire fooling with gun, which is loaded and supposedly locked. It is not. Bang! A cloud of earth thrown into the air. Lenehan jumps out shouting he is shot in back. It is only flying dirt that has hit him. It takes minutes to convince him he is alive. He insists he is hit. Pale as ashes. This army will kill itself yet. We move to pines. Hell lets loose. We expect a wild night. Flares and signals up. Continue for a half hour. Six of us left. We will all stay in trenches until 10:30, then each team will be on guard five and a half hours. A steady stream of supplies and gun carriages going down road back from lines. Del Duca holds a reception. War has ceased. It is quiet, but for activity on road. Stories of narrow escapes from death in civilian life are told, a subject suggested by accidents and casualties occurring in our compound. I have a feeling of distress from an overloaded stomach. To bed at 10:30, but got no sleep. I lie awake belching and squirming from cramps. I hear only wagons on road.

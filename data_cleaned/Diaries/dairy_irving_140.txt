Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 4 July 1918. Thu. Jul. 4, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Reports of the fray begin to arrive. Lts. wish to go out to get particulars and take check and hearten boys. Capt. remains. Tells the men he would have given all the fortunes in the world to have been with the boys in the first line. Cook comes back shortly with a fishy story about why he did not go out. I believe he could not find his way, and will wait until it grows light to go out. In the meantime post- mortems and more wishes that they were permitted to have been in the fray. Self praise for coolness displayed - in a dugout. Captain comes, pleased with performance of his men, and tells how he awakened the town to be prepared in case of gas. It grows light and officers leave to inspect the men, Perch myself 202on bed and listen to young Kenny explain how he won the battle. Undoubtedly the bravest lad of all the runners, but has too much to say. Talk of gas, and it develops that there is not a single extra mask to be had. What if Stringer had run into gas and there was no mask for him? Fall asleep with Cpl. Hessler on bed beside me, about 3:30. Awake at 5 to find Capt. Sturgis is my bedfellow. Lt. McDougall back. Elated with performance of boys. Him I admire. So do the other men. I go upstairs, while I wait for the report to take to Intelligence. Del Duca and others in group talking about their performance and experiences of the night. Del's squad of Italians are the best fighters in the company. "Grease Balls", who have redeemed themselves. Goldberg back after being out in a shell hole all night. Devlin's squad not yet accounted for. No one wants to sleep. All look fresh, Trophies of fray, a few German grenades. One of our rifles is split down entire length of barrel. It had been hit by a missile around seven. It did not explode while firing. A German sniper's armored breastplate, with bullet hole where collar bone would be, is on exhibition. Machine gun ammunition has been exhausted. Every man threw at least 20 bombs on an average. Now all is quiet except for machine gun from Young's sector, where they are still working. Suggest that report be made out for us to take back. Must wait for Cook or Captain. Cook comes, writes a brief report of victorious engagements, giving it to Gillece, ignoring me as usual. Go back to town. Ask McDougall for any orders. He would like to see report. I call for Gillece, who is well under way by now, to come back. He does not hear me. Run through boyau quite a distance to catch up with him. Bring back and show report to McDougall, who is displeased with it. Not comprehensive enough. He and Cook make out another. Back to town with it, starting at 5:30. Should be in ........ 5:48. Gillece worried. I reason with him, it is not our fault. Hurry going through boyau with hand on pistol, ready for instant use if intercepted. Much damage done to unshored cups and CT along the line of the boyau. No incident on way. Handed report to Lt. Griffiths 6:00. Scolded for being late. Tell him what I know about the battle. His men were up but were not sent out. He and Sgt. went to town OP to observe progress. Difficulty in finding place in the dark. No use going to bed until after breakfast. I am starving. To kitchen, where I must fry a few pieces of bacon and with bread make a sandwich to appease hunger, while I tell cooks and S C men of my experiences. Breakfast ready now. Bacon, potatoes, bread, coffee. Say it is my opinion that I will go to bed. Sgt., who has just come in to breakfast, asks if I would not like to take a message to Batt. Hdqrs. before I go to sleep. Yes, of course I will. Go upstairs at once. Ask boys if there is anything they would like from the YMCA. Get a commission to get chocolate and matches. Get the wheel. Ask Lt. if he needs anything. He does not, so I go off at once. Get to Hdqrs. Talk to Atha for a few minutes. No one to be seen in the office. See Sgt. Fisher through an open door, call him. Sgt. Major comes out, takes it and gives it to Nichols, who is still asleep. Look for letters I had intended to mail. Find I have forgotten them. Ask if anything is going back. A message for E. I sign for it. Go to YMCA. It is closed. Back to quarters. Major on horseback passes me on road. Walk up hills too steep for riding. In quarters, read, go to sleep at 8:00. Awake at 12:00 for dinner. Steak, potato, tomato sauce, macaroni, coffee, bread. Write a letter to Mama, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Medoli. Kidded considerably for writing so much. Supper, Beef stew, toast, coffee. Write again until 7:10. Sgt. picks a detail of men to go with him and Lt. on an ambush patrol. They leave behind, bayonet, canteen and steel helmet, arm themselves with bombs, rifle and 203pistol, and leave before dark. I am gas guard from 2 to 4. Wooster comes with a message from Batt. Hdqrs. for Lt. No one knows where he has gone. Conway goes to Co. Hdqrs. to find out where he is, then Gillece and Ward go out to look for him. Of course they cannot find him. He has already gone out on No Man's land. Wooster stays for a while and reports back to Batt. Hdqrs. During the night another message comes for the Lt. It is about report being late this morning. Major wants to know why. Sleep until 2. Himpler wakes me with a lot of fuss and feathers at 1:40. I protest and get up at 1:50. Go down with stool, where it is dark and quiet. I am cold, without sweater, which I have loaned to Black. I cough considerably. Halt a few men from F, who have relieved E Co., which went back to ........ for a rest of a few days. Patrol comes back at 2:30, having done nothing and encountered no one. Some of the men went to sleep in No Mans Land. Grows light. Bethink myself of going to railway station at end of street, quite near, to see what it is like. Been here so long and never thought of going north of our quarters. Look for something to eat in kitchen. Find dried apples. Machine gun firing and little shelling in sector to our left ceases at daybreak. Airplanes have been active over sector to ascertain extent of damage done during the night. They are shelled heavily from both sides. Shelling during day not very active. None in or near town. Devlin's squad and all others accounted for. After supper I go to Company Hdqrs. to get a telegram, which I have been told is there for me. I expect it is a cablegram of congratulations on my wedding anniversary. So it proved. I came near not getting it. Haight tells me it is packed up. I say, packed up or not, I must have them. He sees I am in earnest, promises to get it for me. It is only a little suitcase that must be opened. He is the laziest man in the company. Captain is in very good humour. He again asks me what I hear from home. Fine, I say. To myself I say, I hope so always. Please God.

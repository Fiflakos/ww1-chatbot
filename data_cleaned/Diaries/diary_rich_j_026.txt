Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 28th October 1914. Nationality: Australian. Oct. 28th. I finished up guard at 8 o'clock this morning having spent most of the day in-doors and the night on deck. At 4 a.m. I went on the hospital door for 4 hours. but as there was about 12 transports on my side and lovely Orion and his train of stars overhead. My first watch was from four to eight in the afternoon on the poop deck. My duty was to keep men away from the isolation areas which contain 30 venereal patients with three already discharged. This seems terrible on one ship only and gives an idea of the prevailence of this disease even in Sydney where prostitution is prohibited. 91 outdoor patients attended the hospital cheifly with influenza. The sun hasc shone in patches only to-day there has also been showers of rain The evening came on with a pretty variety of dull daub coloured clouds when there appeared a bluish light in the West which grew & grew first to purple and on to crimson which in turn gave place to real gold effects which reflected as yellow haze all around us, and gave the regular wavelets from the ships side to the shore, some 400 yards, the remarkable appearance of golden stairs It was a glorious sunset, and the remarkable part was the short space of time from in which it all happened, about 15 minutes only. I tried to sleep on the open deck until 4 a.m. when I went on duty again, but matters were very quiet and I enjoyed the coming of dawn day. Day commenced to break at 4.30 with a set of pretty greys changing every moment, but unlike the sunset of the previous evening, its coming progressed slowly and surely with changing greys and wonderful soft shadows Gradually the stars disappeared until even those of the first magitude had melted out. The 22 22 well lighted transports at anchor and up making a fine show during the dark hours of the night now faded into insignificance and left the huge hulks standing out against the skyline in such irrigular fashion that they seemed to spoil the transquil beauty of the Sounds and the suns dainty preliminaries to another day's work. TheA powerful lighthouse on a huge granite boulder island at the which marks the entrance is struggling fitfully, almost painfully to sustain its poud proud brilliancy but the surrounding sky grows lighter and offer no background or assistance and it slowly sinks beyond recognition. As the "two blb bells" proclaim the hour of 5 o'clock. the twilight gives as last gives way seccums to the day, and the cold looking transports show up their adornments and graceful ease once again. This business of guarding hospital approaches seems a very funny business indeed for a fighting spirit to contend with. The New Zealand contingent arrived in St Georges Sound at noon to-day, accompanied by some four warvessels. There appeared to be 8 transports while I believe their number is about 8,000. men. The whole ship seems to be settling down in good style at present. There is much gambling going on, the "Top of the House" being the most popular pool game. Poker & banker (on the quite) still goes on and it is common to hear of men winning & losing from anything up to 60.0.0. Notice is now given that all gambling must cease.

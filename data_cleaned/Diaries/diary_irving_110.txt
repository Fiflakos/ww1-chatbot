Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 3 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. Jun. 3, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Struggle into line at Reveille. CO sees me but does not look long enough to inspire him to penalize me. Realises I am not expected to be prompt, having worked all day yesterday. Breakfast will be taken with old platoon. So will rest of day's meals. Rice, bread, coffee. Suggest that since I returned, meals are not as advertised. Perhaps I mm a jinx. Told by Haight that SOS class will assemble at usual place at 7:30. Inform the boys. I will be excused for duty at Batt. Hdqrs. Lieut. complains that good men are taken away from his. I wonder does he include me? In office at 7:30. Fox comes later. Almost finished with counting individual sums. Next task is to total columns and verify addition and strike grand total. Lt. in early, apparently pleased with progress we have made. Gives no instructions to convert into francs, making extensions for each item. That lengthens the job considerably. I had counted on completing original share of the work early in afternoon, perhaps doing much needed washing and then going to town to buy a wedding ring for myself and a few toys for baby, with a souvenir for Leah. Will take a chance on being turned back for lack of pass. Gas Lt. about, warned by Sgt. Major to put on mask for usual half hour period. I cannot work comfortably in it. Rather than inconvenience myself, I shut door and listen for footsteps on the stairs. Work till 12. Lt., second in command at SOS school, comes to ask about his pay. He is a peculiar man. Appears not to know me. A good mess, yet not up to standard of camp on farm. Boiled beef, potatoes, boiled onions, bread, coffee. Report to office immediately after. On homestretch now. Work is being held up by me. I am not able to add a single column of figures correctly. Fox, whom I have always excelled, is in good form fortunately, for the success of assignment, but cruel to my feelings. I am annoyed at this in spite of myself. Lt. makes his afternoon visit. Gives me a ray of hope that I may be spared drill in the future. Payrolls will no longer be figured at Batt. Hdqrs. He will head a new department, a statistical bureau which will take care of all clerical work for entire regiment. One company clerk from each organization to be taken by him for permanent duty. To be stationed at ........., according to plans. Would like to take me in preference to Sweet, our Co. Clerk. I cannot believe my ears for a time. Asks me about qualifications. Tell him on request what I did as civilian. Considered a fairly good printer, acquainted with forms. Have printed some for Navy Dept. Will let me know. It is quite natural that my work should become worse from here on. Delay is such that supper time overtakes me before we are done. To show my appreciation for his consideration for me, I would like to surprise Lt. with completed work in morning. Ask Fox to come back after mess and finish sums in American money. Agrees. Mess. Bully beef, cheese, bread, coffee. Keep my appointment with Fox at 7. He has not yet arrived. Lt. is there. He would like to have amounts in Frs. by 9 tomorrow morning. I am most anxious to please him. Will work until dark. When Fox comes I tell him what Lt. asks. He is as mad as a hatter. Throws down his pencil. Refuses to go on. Let him alone. Tell him only to report his decision to Sgt. who will get me other help and let him digest that until better reason prevails. He goes out to find Lt. and talk with him. Comes back a quarter hour later, nice as you please, brings a bar of chocolate as a peace offering. I am having difficulty with a column of figures in Frs. cannot make it correspond with our money. Capt. comes in to fill his pen. Try to help him. When he leaves he asks me what I hear from home. I tell him. Asks if I would like to be home. Very much, if only for an hour. Elated that he shows a good human trait. Forgive him for his past sins against me. Work until it is too dark to see, on the same column of figures. I an getting along very poorly with what I promised to have done by AM. Quit and decide to ask Supply Sgt. procure me assistance in morning which he had proffered earlier in the evening. Try to get a cup of coffee at the ration dump. None to be had. Go to quarters. Reagan waiting for me. So hungry that I ask Dougherty for a piece of the hard tack he is chewing. Fill my water bottle for my morning ablutions, arrange blankets and get into tent before Reagan with the hope that I fall asleep before he begins to chatter. That is a habit of my own that now has proven hateful to me. I like to be alone with my thoughts at night. I am in for another discussion with my bunkmate. We talk for an hour on the causes of war. Reagan has studied the subject. Nationalism is to blame. I defend my point of view. Commercialism is the chief factor, Nationalism subordinate. He is annoyed with me. Bids me goodnight. I make the best of the rest of the night. My eyes so tired at the end of day's work that I am reminded of the old days in the shop when it was a daily occurrence. While at work, subconsciously I worry about Leah and the baby. A new order about movement has been issued. List of articles to be carried in pack or worn is issued from Orderly Room. Do not know what has been going on outside of Hdqrs. office. I say a prayer that today's order is what will eventually be decided upon. An air raid during the night which I do not hear. I am too tired to do anything but sleep well. Lt. Jensen leaves us as per RSO.

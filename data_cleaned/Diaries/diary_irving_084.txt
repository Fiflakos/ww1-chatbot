Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 8 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. May 8, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up at 5:30. This will be a big day's work for men. They go out on drill field to remain all day. Field kitchen and water carts go along. Mess in field. Drill, gas, bayonet, dig trenches under simulated battle conditions. Breakfast, oatmeal, bacon, toast, coffee. Have time to shave, wash and tidy up before reporting to Batt. Hdqrs. for duty. Finish E Company payroll in early forenoon. Begin on F, less involved. Before noon preliminary work is done. It is cold in the office while outside the sun warms wonderfully. Hands and feet numb. Must rub them to keep up circulation. Clear up and call off figures outside in courtyard, walking up and down to relieve stiffness in limbs. Get away for mess early because I do not know what arrangements have been made to feed men who remain behind on special duty. I may have to go out to kitchen in drill field. Pass courtyard where kitchen was to find one cook left behind who has made coffee over a fire of faggots and is serving sandwiches, cheese, jam. Do not go for my own mess kit, but borrow one from cook. He fills it up with bread, cheese, marmalade and jam. Double ration for first portion. Help myself to as much more as I like. Good coffee. Sgts. MacWhinney and McGay entertain us with observations of activities at front. Go to quarters to get my overcoat. I propose to throw it over my knees to use as a blanket for warmth. Good idea. Much more comfortable working. I go outside for a few minutes to stretch my limbs. Orderly Kelly tells me that mail has come in from the States and that he has seen letters for me in pile. I imagine he is jesting but consider it is worthwhile to go to our orderly room for the possible pleasure of reading a letter from Leah. I promise to buy Tallon a bottle of wine if I find a letter from home. Go with a light heart. Our company clerk, the man who never smiles, gives me no encouragement, except a listless yes to my question, making me wait a long time before he bestirs himself sufficiently to sort my letters from pile. One from Leah and one from Mama. The happiest moment since April 2nd when baby was born. Thank God for cheerful news her letter contains. The bravest little girl in the world wrote that letter and the most loving one. I, Leah and Baby become the owners each of a Liberty Loan Bond of the third issue. I am officially noted by citizenry of Staten Island as being with the colors. Happy that Leah was strong enough to write one week after the baby was born. Please God she will remain strong and brave. Can work only with difficulty after reading letters. Officers come in but I continue reading. Tallon has a bottle of wine coming to him. At 6:10 I finish work. Get mess kit. Men have just come back, tired and perspiring. Meet Captain as company is dismissed. He wants to know what I am doing. I tell him. He is not pleased. He wants me for machine gun squad. Supper, cheese, jam, bread, figs, coffee. After mess I intrude on a group cleaning machine guns. Corporal tells me he has recommended me for permanent assignment. I am to report to him when relieved of present duties. Better than being expected to kill a man with a bayonet. Watch gun being assembled. Return to write until 8:30. Then go in search of Tallon to buy his wine. I peep into office of major. Tallon at work. Looks very busy. Best to wait for a favorable opportunity to present itself. Meet Callahan and two men of his squad, all far from being temperance men who are detailed to close up saloons. Like a New York policeman's job. Two other men from company are detailed to guard water carts. Back in billets Read letter from Leah once more in failing light. Make bed and go to sleep. Restless all night Thank God for the letter from Leah and pray for the continuance of the good health of my two girls. Heavy bombardment all day long. Kept up all night without a stop. A big squadron of aeroplanes go over to the front. We from our position, far back in the lines, think that all the world is at war, every cannon in the world being fired at once, in spite of the fact that bulletins posted at Hdqrs. tell us that it is quiet at the front, situation unchanged, etc. During the night a successful air raid was carried out somewhere in the neighborhood. I do not hear report of bombs which were dropped. Everybody else did. Searchlights play, anti-air guns fire at planes. We do not know result.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 24 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Wed. Jul. 24, 1918 Weather: Rain, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. Bread, bacon, coffee. It rains a little. My blankets are out on the line to air for the first time in a month. Must take them in. Make Johnnie Himpler give me a haircut. Get a pail to sit on, which answers the purpose of a swivel chair. A bum pair of scissors are procured from Ellbogen. Get a towel, sit outside under a tree and the operation begins. My hair is long and wiry. Himpler has a hard time cutting it and breathes hard. Must rest to ease his fingers which grow stiff. Interrupted by the rain, which patters through the trees. Must pull them (blankets?) in. Barber shop moves indoors too. Admiring onlookers gather around. Tell barber to cut my neck off. Johnnie is careful and wishes to make a good job of it. I look at the finished job with the aid of two mirrors. It pleases me. Wash and talk with boys for a while. Wait for Lt. Griffiths to come in. I want to ask him about shoes, underwear, overcoat, etc. He thinks it best for me to go to company headquarters and requisition for what I need. He can give me a pass to ........ if I wish, which will give me an opportunity to look up my blanket roll at either ........ or ........ . Would I like to have one? I sure would. Suggests that I go to- morrow, for it looks like more rain. That will do to perfection. My fondness for Griffiths increases. Tell the boys my good fortune. Tell them to make sure to give me orders for anything they may want. I propose to buy presents for Leah, baby, Mama and the girls. Look forward to my excursion with pleasure. Write in my bunk. Rather uncomfortable. Schlesinger, I observe, is doing something in his bunk, with his new pen, which absorbs his attention. He is writing poetry I find out later. It is raining again. Continues for an hour or more. Allen is going to the Company Hdqrs. I ask him to see if there is any mail for me. He will. Dinner is ready soon. Mealy uncooked spaghetti, prunes, coffee, bread. No seconds. A little rest. Resume writing in my bunk by candlelight. Schlesinger interrupts me, asking me to edit his poetry. He has a good idea, but as far as the poetry is concerned, it is awful. I cannot make him understand that it cannot be scanned. It has no feet or rhythm. Only rhymes. I do not like to discourage him, but I can ill afford to give my time to him. I have him make a few corrections, after which he returns and interrupts again. I try to make him see, as tactfully as possible, that I have no time for him. He insists that I give up my work for him. Boys go to YMCA for me to get crackers and cigars. Enjoying my vacation properly. Allen comes back with a letter from Leah, 3 o1d ones from Lottie, one from Mike and one from Abe Gold, who is in ........ where our regiment was. I read my letters. Schlesinger intrudes again. This time I insist that he must let me read my letters. Surprised to find Goldie in France. Mike's letter is good to read. Everybody tells me how pretty my Cecilie is. Leah has good news and so has Lottie. Thank God. Still no pictures. That disappoints me. I look at Schlesinger's poem again. It is becoming a worse muddle. He makes more corrections and finally leaves it with me to 238look over at my leisure. Company F has received an American cook and we have for supper, bacon, doughnuts and coffee. We make it a matter of competition among us to see who can get another doughnut from the Mess Sgt. I and a few others manage to get some. By praising the cooks and their output, I wheedle a doughnut out of them. Look for Lt. Griffiths. Hear Court Martial proceedings against me are being squashed. Lt. is at his supper and must not be disturbed. I will return later. In about an hour during which I have been writing, I look for him again. Find him in. Very courteously gives me a pass for to- morrow from 7 AM to 9 PM. Advises where to buy and a chat about next move. Italy and ........ still hot favorites. Tell the boys to get their orders ready. Work on my version of a story of a day for Leah. Work on that until lights are ordered out. Frenchmen come around to peddle wine. Nobody buys. We have another story-telling contest. Wade and Howe are chief entertainers. Days tells one once in a while. They tell some of the funniest stories I ever heard. I must laugh. Tallon comes in very late. Runners protest against the noise again. No attention paid to them until 12 o'clock, when our men think it is time to go to sleep. Boys wiggle, squirm, scratch, itch. Requires all the will power they can muster to refrain from scratching. I begin to scratch. Things crawl over me, bite, keep me from sleeping. Boards are hard. My back and sides hurt from lying on them. Blankets and pillow are dusty and dirty. Smell of must and damp. Fall asleep after twelve. Nothing but practice machine gun firing in the quarry heard. Three aeroplanes up in the morning, draw shell fire. A few shots from the artillery, a summary of the day's activity. An air of uncertainty about everything. No one seems to want to do anything. Hear three Germans walk into the lines of the 307th to give themselves up. Official news. Newspapers tell of great successes of Americans at Chateau Thierry. Thousands of prisoners taken, ground gained and guns captured. Some of the men anxious to get into action in a lively sector. Officers are being taken from us and shifted to duty elsewhere. Schlesinger gives up trying to intrude on my time. Takes his poem and confides to Ward. I hear him tell Syrop what a wonderful critic I am. Tells things I never knew about myself, while I make believe I do not hear. Ginsberg is in the Hospital ..........

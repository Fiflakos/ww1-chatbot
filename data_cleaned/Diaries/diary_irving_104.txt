Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 28 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. May 28, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up at 5:30. Guard tells of hole made by bomb during last night's raid about 200 yds. back of last tent. Boys go up to inspect it and come back with souvenirs of steel fragments from it. I must shave and have no time to go up. Shave, wash, police. Breakfast. Bully beef, hashed, bread, coffee. Clean gun for a few minutes. Fritz disturbs our meal again by sending a few shells over. He seems to have shortened range. They sound nearer. Out early to meet company which has camped out overnight. We are to act as guides for them and lead them into trenches again for observation. On arrival we find camp already broken. They have made up their packs and are ready to move. I assume an attitude of importance. Greet boys. Ask them how they spent night. They all confess to having slept well. I am surprised. Attribute it to fact that they were very tired from day's hiking and activity at night, inspection of positions. Company starts. I lead 1st platoon into their position. I do not know anything of its location. I ask Maloy who was with them last. I try not to display my ignorance. Lts. and Sgt. assign to corporals responsibility for making various improvements on existing system by cutting new CT and establishing snipers and OP latrines, dugouts and other things necessary for comfort in trenches. I offer my suggestions and point out points of importance in their sector to Sgt. He takes little notice of me and goes on with his own plans. Nothing for me to do but to sit down and rest from my arduous labors. Shells are still coming over at ten minute intervals. Being in the open I cannot see where they strike. Observe effect through my glasses. Raise a great cloud of dust or smoke where they hit. Distance from us greater than I suspected. Watch air battles directly over front line through glasses. Lt. steals upon me unawares. Says good morning and looks as though he expects me to be busy as a bee. I immediately make apologies for my lack of work. At 9:45 company is ready to leave trenches. I follow without knowledge of what is to follow. Still I cannot find anything to do. We merely walk at head of column and look wise. Officers know way as well as we. Company rests until ten. So do we. Company leaves. We remain. No orders for us. Our Lts. not about. Find a canteen. Buy chocolate. Strike for home in a roundabout way at a slow pace. Back at ll. Rest until dinner time. Lt. informs us we bathe at 4. Do not go out. 2nd Lt., a Sgt., a Corp., and a Pvt. are ordered to Brigade Hdqrs. I help Lt. pack up. Mess. Steak, onions, boiled potatoes, bread, coffee. Excellent. 1st Lt. goes to town, leaving corporal in charge. I write all afternoon. A letter to Bertha, Dolly, Ma and Pa Block, Leah. At 4 we assemble and march to 1st Battalion Scouts quarters to join them. They are not ready to go. Wait until 5 picking 4 leaf clovers in the meantime. Find one and lose it later. Lt. comes up. I was lying down and did not notice he was an officer. Speak to him as I would to a private. Nothing said. I am ashamed of conduct. Column moves off. Fritz sends a few pills that sound nearer still. We take a road different from one which leads to baths I noticed on Sunday, about which I informed Lt. On the road I hear whistle of shell. Unconsciously duck my head as if that would save me from hurt if it strikes near. See a few old holes. Observation planes and balloons up. Baths are in English camp at ........ . Same as those near our old billet. Disappointed. Meet Kronenberg in town. Bath attendant knows nothing of arrangements to have us bathe. No orders. We may wait till seven if we wish or come back to-morrow. Decide to come back to-morrow. Boys stay in town a bit to see if drink can be obtained. I go back to camp alone after I give Gillece the bottle of wine I owe. Tired from the tramp by the time I get back. The band is playing in a field for a Co. of Tommies who go up the line. Play for an hour or more. I get my supper. Bread, cheese, jam, coffee. Write until 8:30. Make bed, hand my letters to Lt. for censoring. He has just come back. Tells us of damage done by shelling on road and numbers of casualties. Warns us to keep away. I go up to examine hole made by bomb. Look for scrap. A hole 2 ft. deep and 6 ft. wide, earth thrown up all around it. Go to bed at dark. Talk for a while with Gillece. I am very sleepy. Expect to get a good nights sleep because it is quiet. Doomed to be disturbed once more. A party of our men at school getting instructions in sending up flares and wiring at night. Noise and bright light keep me awake. It also attracts German airmen almost immediately. Excited commands to stop sending up flares but too late. Enemy over us. A prolonged battle to drive them away, shelling him from wood behind us sounds almost in my ear. A few reports from the line. I can kiss my nights rest goodbye, I think. But I am so tired I fall asleep in spite of it all. Sleep better than at any time since arrival. Turn over two or three times during night to find comfort and keep warm but doze off again. A company of Scots have been at a sham battle in woods, bushes and pasture all day. They use a number of smoke bombs which from distance where we were this morning appear to be gas shells. We carry masks at alert, ready for any emergency. Feel a sense of comfort after I write to Mother-in- law and sisters. An obligation I owe them for their kindness to Leah. On the whole the day's martial activity has been negligible. Very quiet. An unusually easy day as far as work is concerned too. I prefer school to drill.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 2 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thu. May 2, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good, leg sore Up at 6:00. Reveille. Wash. Go up for breakfast. Last platoon in line. Good portion of oatmeal, lots of bread and butter, coffee. Enabled to save a piece of bread. Promises of a fair day at last. Sun has not been seen since last Saturday noon. I notice that after a few day's quiet at the front clouds seem to lift until heavy firing begins again. Up for drill with packs, same as yesterday. From now on they will be worn at all drill formations. An hour spent in forming companies and setting helmets on packs to conform to new regulations. To drill field past prison camp. Stop on road to work at manual. Rest while patrols of picked men are sent out from both ends of company to surround area and meet at target butts. Corporal and second in command taken out on patrol, leaving me in charge of squad. Remainder of company marched up to meet patrol. Company formed. Up embankment to drill field. Fall out for 25 minutes, which raises Captain back into good graces of men. Lie down on grass, dry for the first time in three days. Sun comes out at last. Remains out for rest of day. Instructors in gas mask drill come along. Take entire company in hand, after which machine gun squads go out for instruction. Our corporal, out last night, not feeling well, lays down on his work, telling stories of war instead. Very interesting experiences he has had in his four years in the service . Gives us many valuable pointers on trench life. Lessons over at 12. Rest while watching non-coms get bayonet work. Back to billets at 12:30. After regular mess time when we get in. Mess is steak, mashed potatoes, coffee. Too late in line. Steak is all gone. We get prime piece of fried ham, lots of potatoes and coffee. I divide my piece of bread among five men. Barely time to wash our mess tins before we are called out again. By a short cut to drill field. Get same gas mask lessons as in morning, by our officers this time. Colonel and General paying us a visit. Captain beams and dances attendance. Superiors in good humor. Bombing lesson from my corporal from standing and kneeling positions. Bayonet work by our Sgts. Back at 4:15. Wait in courtyard for retreat. Mess. Bully beef, bread, marmalade, coffee. Clean gun, write, change clothes, bathe at pump in field, shave, empty my barracks bag and order its contents. Bathe my feet. Rub sore leg with camphorated oil, which I find in my bag. To bed at 10. A discussion about the war among the boys until they are hooted to sleep by boys not taking part. Prospects of peace in near future discussed by all men about these parts. English, Americans and French talk about it as something in progress. A certain bulletin quoted as saying that Allies have made overtures. This gives rise to the question of returning to the States and the method of demobilizing the National Army. Transport and food problems considered. Most of the men would prefer to stay in France for a few months. I take no part whatever in conference. For my part I do not think peace is imminent. The spirit of the war has gripped both sides with such an unbreakable hold that it will take more than a year to disengage it. The old story of our doubts about conscription being enforced and then our doubts about the National Army being sent to France. I consider it by no means uncertain that we will go further down the line as our state of training warrants. I will be prepared to go whenever we are sent. Think it much better to go forward quickly and have the job done with if we must go eventually, than to stay about in idleness for a few months. Clean my gun thoroughly. Probability of an inspection tomorrow at first drill formation. I do not propose to be noted for having a dirty piece as often happened while at camp. Apparently nothing of importance going on along the front. It is comparatively quiet. What few shots we hear may be practice firing. Corporal instructing us in machine gun thinks it is firing of the French mortars within our own camp area and for want of better authority we accept his judgment. Some reports very loud followed by a swish which seems to travel over the hills and then another report from behind us, the echo. It travels on and on until it is lost in the distance. Slight air activity.

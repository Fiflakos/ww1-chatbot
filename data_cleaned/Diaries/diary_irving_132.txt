Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 26 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. Jun. 26, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up again at 6. We all stand to in trench. Order not understood. We can see no reason for it, but we obey. Wash in a little stream in the fields. Visit our comrades with whom we chat while waiting for breakfast. Told happenings of the day in their sector. The fourth platoon has been under shell fire, shrapnel hitting among the men and whistling around their heads. Vitkin comes nearest to being hit. Corp. Fox, PT Thompson and Carney meet with an accident, which severely injured them. They had picked up a detonator from somewhere in the trench. In spite of repeated orders not to pick up or fool with anything in the nature of an explosive that might be found. It is never sure that such an object is dead. There are a hundred reasons why it has not exploded, but it may if tampered with. This same detonator had been kicked about by Clark all day, when Fox, a brave, picked it up and examined it, perhaps hammering it. While taking it apart, it went off, blowing his hand to shreds so that he may lose it, injuring Thompson along the arms and on the chest painfully, and cutting a jagged gash in the hand of Carney, whose life was probably saved by providentially having the injured hand up to his face in the act of eating a piece of bread, else his head would have been blown off. Pvt. Rodder was so frightened during the shelling yesterday, that he ran back to barracks at .......... . Move our belongings back into the woods on other side of the road, into our home by day. On the way I see a tree loaded with cherries. I tell Corp. about it. He and I go thither to pick a capful. I eat cherries to my heart's content. Bring some back for the boys. Take off shoes, leggings and stockings and lie down for a nap until dinner time. Boiled beef, potato, bread, coffee. I go to town of .........., ten minute's walk away from where we are encamped. There is a YMCA in that place where I get crackers, cigarettes and writing paper for the boys, furnishing the necessary capital, for every one of our party is broke. Get a newspaper too. I am so pleased with the courtesy of the worker in charge, that I stay to chat for a few minutes. In the center of town there is a barn. Although very near to the front, this town has not suffered much from shelling. Buildings are all intact, except for a few at farther end of village. A fair sized grocery store where I see American canned condensed milk on the shelves. Back with my purchases to be scolded for not having bought more. Cakes are relished. Del Duca again goes picking cherries. Two men from the main body of company visit us. They have rifles with them and are anxious to get some practice. Maloy and Himpler think that is a good idea and will do likewise. They know of a big hollow in the ground near where Del Duca is in the cherry tree, which can be used as a range. They go off to shoot. I had been writing, at which I continue. Our guns send over seven or eight shots in rapid succession. As usual, the first one coming unexpected startles. After that I do not pay any attention to them. I can distinctly hear the report of our rifles from the range. Suddenly a big explosion near us. I say "To-day's souvenir from Fritz" and think no more of it. A second later Maloy and Himpler, pale and excited, panting for breath come back. The trouble is that they had been using an unexploded Stokes trench mortar shell, which lay in the excavation, for a target. What I thought was Fritzs shell was the detonation from the 187trench mortar projectile which went off immediately. How they saved their lives they did not know. No one was hurt, by a miracle. A bigger hole was made, dirt and pebbles flew fifty feet into the air. The boys ran at the rate of a thousand yards a minute. If these things are kept up, the company will have no need to go into the trenches. They will destroy themselves. Fritz makes no return of our shelling which ceased when work of single gun is finished. Supper, greatly delayed, meat, bread, butter, coffee. Potatoes come up as I am leaving to go back to camp. Take a few and eat on road. Write. Take a stroll in the woods to Frenchmans camp. We tease each other. Dusk coming on. Must return to await orders. They are, to move to our night quarters. Take up post in trench and await further orders. When we are settled, runner comes with written orders to make up packs, be ready to move. We are to go back to barracks and be relieved by 2nd and 3rd platoon men. I am undeniably happy to know that I will be in a comparatively safe place to-morrow. My pack is ready rolled. I had not opened it since arrival. Boys prepare to move. "Hullo, Del Duca? a message." Capt. directs that you and your squad remain, unroll packs an make yourselves comfortable for the night. I am again disappointed. It is a quiet night, Perhaps nothing will happen to me, either today or to- morrow. I put my trust in the Lord. What the boys say about the National Army and its commanders would make a stone image blush. Nothing can be done, however, but to stay. Guard is posted. I had intended to ask for 12-2 watch. It is arranged that Rubin and I are on duty then without my knowledge. Pleased at the thought that I will be awake to usher in the first anniversary of my Wedding Day. I lie down to sleep at 10. Say a prayer of thanks for the happiness, good health and prosperity, which have been ours in the past year and ask that continued happiness be given my loved ones by our lord. Sleep for a little more than an hour. Up at 11:45 to take my post. It is a silent world I look upon from our trench. The church bell strikes the hour of twelve. I say a prayer in the presence of Rubin. A thanks offering. I am not mindful of the presence of Rubin. I know he understands. I talk of Leah and of home, her goodness, her virtues, of baby and our past pleasures. How happy I am to-night that my hands are still unstained with blood. I do not long for home. I would only ask the privilege of seeing the tears in Leah's eyes when she receives my flowers to-day, please God. I would be content with hearing her say "Dear Boy". Silence for a few minutes. Reagan comes up to tell us gas alarm signal is to be given on a brass shell case, which he gives us. Two aeroplanes are up. One is a Hun. I hear his motors distinctly. At right angles to him, and making for him is one of our machines. They manoeuver for position for half an hour until we cannot hear them from the distance. Again it is a quiet, moonlit night. Only sound of two husbands confiding in each other and the occasional "put, put" from a machine gun. Meet a Frenchman who talks German quite well. Practice shooting with a pistol. Hit bullseye, first shot. To bed at 2, undoing my pack, extra blanket making a warm bed. Two hours on duty pass quickly and I am hardly aware of the cold.

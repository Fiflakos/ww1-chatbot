Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Wed. Aug. 14, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Fair, Very Tired Into the Valley of Death and Desolation. Hike about 50 Kilos during the day. Some men are killed at the edge of the wood by the bombs the Boche dropped last night. Horses killed and equipment damaged. Up at 7:00. Breakfast with HQ Co. Uncooked 281bacon, bread, coffee. Meet some of the men who were left behind where we embarked on the lorry train for this part of the country. With Lt. Stevens in charge, they have hiked as many as 25 kilos a day with little food and rest and no medical attendance. They are foot-sore and sore at heart over the fact that they were not permitted to travel with us. I make an attempt to lead McFinch back to my tent to see Doherty. The length of the trip is too much for Mac. He turns back. I wash and take a short nap, as far as the heat and flies will permit. The tent is so hot that it has to be camouflaged with boughs to keep the sun out. I lie on my stomach to read some old letters of Leah's and I write for the remainder of the morning. Dinner a wonderful one. We have beef stew, bread pudding and coffee. I scrape the pan which contained the pudding. There is crust on the sides and bottom. Another man employed similarly. I ask him what my wife would say if she could see me now. Millions of flies which have feasted on dead men and horses share my meal with me. It almost takes away all desire to eat. When I pass a pile of rotting bones, my stomach feels as though it will give up its contents. The smell is constantly in my nose, though I am far away from the source. Take a nap again. Write until 1 o'clock. Then Cpl. Doherty calls me to take a message to 2nd Batt. Hdqrs. Regrets that he cannot get me a bicycle. I am glad that is the case. I prefer to ride in lorries than to push a bicycle uphill. I have time to myself, a pleasant afternoon hiking and riding about the country. No one knows where it is that I have to go. The name of the place is ........ and the direction I am to take is shown me on a map. With the aid of signposts, in addition to that, I will get there. Cut short Doherty's fears and leave. Walk along the dusty hot road reading the papers I carry, a thing I always do to be able to deliver the message verbally in case the papers are lost or I am hurt. Also, anxious to see if they contain something in reference to the men who go home. Ask MP if I am on the right road, so as to guide me. Every few hundred yards, I must stop breathing or faint from the stench. There are dead horses and decay everywhere. A ration wagon comes, going to give me a lift as far as the foot of the first hill. D Company living in funk holes by the roadside. I meet Jacobson and tell him of my fortune, which was not destined for me after all. Now I do not know which way to turn. There are three roads and no signposts. Stop into a circular hut, where are some men and G Co.'s packs, to enquire for 2nd Batt. Hdqrs. They direct me along a path which is in a different direction from the instructions the last signpost gave. I am puzzled and stay to argue the matter. The warning hiss of an onrushing shell. I hide behind a barricade of packs and pray. The shrapnel falls all around us. Four or five shells are sent. This will be no picnic for me, but I must go on with important papers. I hurry up the hill to the ........ farmhouse where the kitchens are. Perhaps I may find the Major or his adjutant there. They visit occasionally. On the way, there is a horse killed last night. Others dead many days, perhaps weeks. Unfortunately, I cannot hold my breath long enough to pass. I shudder and shiver at what is ahead of me. Four large farmhouses in a square with a courtyard in the center. Battalion staff there, but no officers. I must go further. Up a hill which is being raked by shell fire, because one of our batteries is there. Along a path in the wood and then for more than a mile under observation and at the mercy of snipers and shells. I think of home and Leah and Cecilie and Mama and say a prayer for the Lord to get me through safely. I find courage. See Gillece and Wade in the yard. They tell me what road I must follow and where hell is. I must pass dead men. They unnerve me. They are pale as death themselves. They have been sent for rations. I hold it is not right to risk 282men's lives for the sake of something to eat. While I talk to them, the shells break on the hill ahead. A crash and the whistle of flying shrapnel. How can I get through? I hesitate. I ask if anybody goes my way. I do not want to die alone. Another man to go with me. He is badly scared too. We start for the hill in the fire. Rush up the hill as fast as I can. The other man sets the pace. He is tired, having been going for 24 hours. His slowness irritates me. It may mean death to me. I am trembling now with the knowledge that Sgt. Greenstein and Wedies were killed on this road last night and Sergeant and Vandenberg were seriously wounded by a single shell. In my ears rings the cry of the man, whose leg was just now torn and mangled. I heard him as I passed the first aid station in the farmhouse, where F Co. men lie dead and others are wounded. The man I am with is carrying rations too. In the wood I breathe easier. I think it is a safe place, not knowing how many men were killed here in the last few days. I offer to relieve my companion of part of his burden, so that he will travel faster. The shells break around us. We hug the earth when we hear them. Out of the woods and now we must travel at the mercy of the Boche. He can see us every inch of the way. It is not safe to proceed. Below and behind us the earth is being torn up. We lie flat and wait. I want to go on. I prevail. It is worse to wait for death than face it. Three men come up. They must travel the same road as we. Let then lead the way. We follow as soon as the planes that watch us are out of hearing. Make a rush for the men. The other man too tired to run. Against my will I go as slowly as he. I do not know the road. Surprised to find I am still alive, whenever I think of life or death. Into the valley by way of a gully. Two men on post in a funk hole. Ranier there too, on his way back to farmhouse. He looks like an animal. Stop to catch our breath and cool off. On down a narrow path, down and down we run, past a dead horse, two dixies of beans, which also tell a story and then two dead men, one on each side of the road. Black from decay. Dead a long time. A million flies on them, which will perhaps eat our food soon. How they smell! I am braver as I pass them than I thought I would be. Down into the village, where there is more death. Fritz can look right into the main street and sees our every movement. We must run like mad. Stones, mud and water from an overflowing well follow us down hill. Here is destruction. Not a soul to be seen. The smell of the dead. Every house torn down and piled in the middle of the street. We must clamber over pieces of wreckage. More men rotting in the sun, one stretched out in the yard of a ruined church. One ambulance and a brave driver ready to take the wounded out when the opportunity offers. To the right, down into a cellar, where is the Major, Capt. McM. and Lt. McD., Kidde, and Lt., Griffiths, the Batallion staff. I deliver my message. I am questioned. Scolded for having taken so long to come. The officers are eating. Fifty million flies buzz and crawl. Breathless. Sick men all around me. Lt. McDougall wants news. I give him what I have. The Captain calls me aside and tells me he is sorry that I cannot go home. I will get a chance again if it is in his power to give it to me. I almost cry but I am not sorry. My deference has been a big one. There is a message to go back at once. Say goodbye informally. Run away from death and destruction. Again I must pass the shelter before I can get out of the village. How I dread to pass the dead men. There I must rest on that hill almost dead from exhaustion. Across the open field while planes are up. High explosives break directly over my head. Frightened. Run until my heart almost bursts. I cannot breathe. Safe in the woods. Safely out. Down the hill into the farmhouse, where the kitchen is, shaken in nerves and mind. I tell 283what I have seen. Get a red hot cup of coffee. Fill my canteen with it too. Take a can of bully beef and some crackers. Surprised that I think of food. Off again down the road. Five minutes after I leave the farm a hundred shells break on the hill behind it. With an officer and a Y man, I hug the earth. Shell fragments fall within two inches of me. I look and I am afraid. I pray for death. Wish I am wounded to end it all and then ask to be spared. I decide to run for the nearby road. Make it safely. See Jacobsen again. Have him follow me while I talk to him. Outside of ........ I get a lift in a lorry to home. I am happy. Find we are moving. Talk, drink coffee, eat. My pack has been rolled for me and will be taken on a limber. Orders that I must go back to Batt. Hdqrs. I am too dazed to think. I do not protest. Take my sentence in silence. No hope for life now. Out on the road in the dark. Pass marching men. A lift in a lorry filled with grenades. Walk again. Our batteries sending a barrage. C Co. moving up. I fall in with then. I am on my belly every minute. Our men shell- shocked, trembling, crying. Manage to get to the farmhouse. Men have been hurt after I last left up the hill into the woods where I am lost. Wander about much on my belly. Meet F Co. Men trying to get down into ........ to relieve another Co. I cannot think. I cannot talk coherently. No one can help me and I have an important message which I have made up my mind to get through. Stumble about; question men whom I cannot see. For an hour I wander. Once I smell gas. Hide in a dugout. Find a way out. Take with me the man who is trying to guide F Co. He is too frightened to follow, too frightened to turn back. Another manikin on my hands. Meet E Co. Stop to question. Gas is encountered. Shake again and bless Rubin for rolling the pack. Go on, calling to my companion constantly by a wrong name. Take mask off. Smell something like horse radish, but it does not kill as I understand. Hesitate. Put on my mask again. Meet H. Co. walking without masks. Order them to put them on. Five men and a Sergeant also without masks. The men are slightly wounded and are being taken to the first aid station in the village. Hard to see with my mask on. Two fires on the horizon. One is distant where the German guns flash and the flares come from. The other in the village where I can see the forms of men silhouetted against it. The dead men do not smell when I have the mask on. They are used as landmarks. We do not run. The gas is strong in the village. A hard time finding headquarters. The fire is in the first aid station of the 300th. Shelling the cause. In the Major's dugout are a swarm of men on the floor all with masks on. Deliver my message. Lie down on the floor, everybody sneezing and coughing. Some vomiting. The village has been an inferno for hours. Some shells have hit the roof of the house but the cellar is as strong as a block house. Hughs, our gas NCO, without a mask, is warning everybody to wear theirs. Everybody excited. I feel the effects of what I have inhaled. It is 2 o'clock, five hours since I got the message, which I do not think was important. Shelling has ceased.

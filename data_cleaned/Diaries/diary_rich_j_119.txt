Should the artillery fail in their workor be required to do further work it would be almost 3 hoursto get onto them.No "Moppers Up" are to be used in the Leap Frog system ofattack. In the first line going through to the 2nd or 3rdobjectives the "Moppers Up" will be about 1/3 of the attackingforce.March 28th. Wednesday.Morning Parade:--Field Firing (At moving targets). Lewis Gun. Stoppages (practice)Artillery formations.Afternoon Parade:--Football match.This Lewis Gun practice is very good indeed. We mustby now all have a good working knowledge of the Gun and itsmakeup. I find the gun is a wonderful weapon; the manner inwhich it is put together is splendid. Its uses in eitherdefense or attack can be made very valuable, even morevaluable than we had previously behind.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 25 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Thursday April 25, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up at 6:00. Not necessary to march up to main quarters of company to stand reveille. Arrangements have been made to take check in our courtyard thus saving us more than a half mile walk. Bugle blows for mess. March up in a body. The line is very long. A half hour's wait to be fed is the rate of the last man. Had we tacked on to end of line it would have taken me until 8:30 to finish breakfast. As I had planned to take a bath, I have reason to swear. I did not know that according to plans each platoon has an opportunity to be at the head of line. We are second, therefore we break in near head. In a few minutes I have a sandwich of bread and crisp bacon, marmalade and coffee. Back to barn. Run out into field with a new suit of underwear under my arm, resolved to take my bath before anything develops to prevent it. I do not know just how that ceremony will be performed. There is only a pump and a wooden tub. Off go my shoes, socks and breeches and underwear. Fill tub and get in for a splash. Cold as ice, so cold I cannot stand in it. Dry lower portion and dress, then take off shirt and work on upper part. Rub hard with towel for long time to guard against cold. Then wash my clothes. Spread them on grass to dry. So ends my first rustic bath. Finish in time to hear bugle for drill. Assemble in main road. March off down road through fields in direction of small British camp. Everything there is quiet and in most perfect order. Calm and air of peace prevails. We ask for permission to use adjoining field for drill purposes. Consent given we enter, intent upon impressing Englishmen about with our prowess. We all try hard to no purpose. Two Britons who are engaged in gardening look up slightly and resume work. A class of signal men do not even pay attention to us. Our showing is unusually poor on account of new men in platoon. They are picked out and drilled by sergeant while we rest and watch English system of sending, Morse code, and listen to a corporal instructing, who I must say knows how to explain what he wants to teach. Our boys laugh because they cannot understand corporal's English. Start back to quarters after a long rest. Dismissed at 11:30, in time to go to the village for a drink, after having a few eggs and bread at farmhouse. Drink only one glass of porter. Wait for others to buy a round. We are all warmed up. On end of mess line, an Italian accuses Reilly, one of trio, of standing on line for a second time. Sgt. comes up, questions Reilly, believes him. I corroborate statement, but Italian continues his abuse until Reilly lets his fist fly, catching other man a bad blow over the eye. Blood flows down his face from cut. He throws his mess kit at Reilly, who wards off blow. I stop cup with my hand, which I later discover is cut. Lt. stops fight. Questions both men. Sees justice of Reillys act and dismisses him without punishment. Get our mess. Beef stew and coffee. No bread. Go down to our quarters where we still have a bit of bread left from yesterday. Sit under a tree in field. Reilly does not enjoy his meal. His hand is hurt. He feels badly because he has never before struck a man. He is wrought up over it all day. Write until 2:30. A formation with gas masks and steel helmets. Guns jolting against hat make music. Helmets hot as blazes. We go for a hike of about 2 miles without a rest. Looked upon as curiosities by English and Americans we meet on the road. Boys resent sneers of Englishmen. Inspection of rifles on road. Fall out for 15 minutes. March back to quarters. Dismissed. Change our hats and go back to main road for retreat. Villagers turn out to look. Bugle blows call to colors accompanied by the hens who do not know what to make of it. They cackle in a horrible discord which creates laughter that cannot be subdued. I try my best to contain myself but I lose control. I am reprimanded. Supper, bread, beef, jam, coffee. Sit in cart to write. Birds, some of which sing, some of which whistle are my only companions. A wonderful evening. Go to bed at 9:00. In the morning the guns in the distance boom away at a fierce rate. Dozens of aeroplanes going toward front in early morning and in late afternoon. One turns and curvettes in the air. I thought for a moment it was winged. Officers much interested in operations. Many rumours about of a great Allied victory. English newspapers come into camp. Snatched up greedily. Drink a glass of milk which cost a penny fresh from the cow. We can have some everyday.

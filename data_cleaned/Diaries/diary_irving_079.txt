Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 3 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. May 3, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good, leg sore Up at 5:45. Reveille. Up for breakfast. Oatmeal, bacon, bread, coffee. Go over gun again to make sure it is clean. Out for drill with packs and other equipment. Captain and 1st Sgt. not with us. They have gone to the front to observe. One of our new Lieuts. in charge of company. Go to drill field. When on main road we assume that a gas attack is likely and carry our masks at the alert position. Not thinking we would carry imagination any further than that, I do not pay attention. Caught by surprise when cry comes from rear "Gas". Halt but foolishly continue to breathe until mask is ready to be put on. Under actual conditions of attack I might have been gassed by the time I had helmet on. Continue walking along road looking like an army of unearthly creatures for 19 minutes. My mask works like a charm. No clouding of eyepieces or excess salivation. Just a little stiffness of the tongue muscles and a bit warmer than normal. Remove masks before we enter drill field. Rest for 10 minutes. Resume work with manual. Then skirmish drill by squads. Annoy Callahan. Take it easy. Assembled to take a little lesson in trench digging. With my small entrenching shovel, I get to work deepening a communications trench. Ground is like clay, stubborn and sticky. Tiring work. Corporal sits on mound and bosses work, for all the world like a foreman of a section gang digging a hole in our country. Does not last long. Get a little close order with entire company, new formations. Go to drill field on other side of detention camp. Fall out for instruction in machine gun. Lesson for the day is cause and remedies for stoppages. Make notes on what is said. Work until time for company to return. Corporal tells us more of his experiences and "how to win the war". Back by short cut. Comfortable travelling. Leg not bothering me at all. Dinner on return. Stew, hard tack, coffee. A little rest before we go out again for drill. Acting C.O. announces that we will send out a platoon in advance, which will take up a position somewhere in the neighborhood of target butts. We will give them a half hour's handicap and then follow in an endeavor to find them. Kidding. Remainder of company goes off by long way around. Hot as blazes in sun. Get a rest. Push on till we reach the main road. Fall out by roadside. Sit down beside a couple of daisies. Pluck them and pull them apart. Both tell me welcome news. Laugh at thought of unusual occupation for a soldier. Push on again sending out scouting parties to look for supposed enemy. Travel along in very leisurely fashion at route step. We come up behind butts without having sighted anyone. Frequent stops to observe and reconnoiter. Scouts come in with reports of failure to locate enemy. March to point where commander is to meet us. Meet up with Colonel when our column is spread all over the road in a very disorderly fashion. Colonel ascertains who is in command of detachment and relieves him, probably raking him a bit. He looks exceedingly discomforted. Not finding our quarry we go back, in better formation. See Colonel again, this time quizzing corporal in charge of an outpost. He calls Lt. Gives him instructions for future conduct. We get back at an easy pace. Clean gun and oil it while waiting for retreat formation. Lt. announces inspection for tomorrow and gives instructions for addressing mail to home. Supper, bully beef, pickles, marmalade, bread, coffee. Write in field by pump, while I am waiting to have my hair clipped. That procedure is gone through with an air of great resignation. I sit on stone basin and view destruction barber is inflicting with a pang of sorrow as each clump of hair falls to the ground. Begins to feel cool immediately. A fine foraging area for mosquitos now. I wash my head of an old collection of scale and dandruff. Feels really good and clean. Back to barn. Take joshing of boys good-naturedly. No need for combing little tuft of hair remaining in front. Morning toilet can be accomplished much quicker. Wait until it grows dark. Clean my shoes and leggings of mud. Make my bed and lie down at 9:30. Sleep well but conscious of dampness all night. Not aware of any sustained action at front. One would almost believe in absence of news to the contrary that peace had been declared. A few distributed shots fired. Aeroplanes active flying in squadrons toward line. Do not notice their return. An occasional burst of machine gun fire heard in air. Many supply wagons and horses have passed down returning from a period of duty behind lines. Tommies looked very tired. Badly in need of rest. Most of then snoozing outside of quarters when we go by in afternoon. Go to village to get chocolate for which I pay a very high price. I must have it at any cost.

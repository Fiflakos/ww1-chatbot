Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 17 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Aug. 17, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Suffering effects of gas Cpl. Rist comes out of the lines in safety to start on his way back to the States on the mission that I was originally recommended for. A complaint by the men in the lines that our own artillery is firing short upon them. It cannot be ascertained which battery is to blame. My throat is sore, my eyes smart, breathing is difficult. I feel nauseous, very tired and little inclined to work. In this state of health it is quite natural that I should feel morbid and easily worried. No men from either E or F Co. has shown up to draw rations. Daylight not the time to get food into the lines unobserved. Lt. Scott very much worried about something. He lets me talk to him and contents himself with answering merely, for about an hour. Capt. Harrington, who has remained to carry to a conclusion the mission on which he was sent, has come back looking for something to eat. There are canned beans for each company in boxes upstairs. They get a can which with bread provides breakfast for 8. The candle is 289put out, the doors opened which makes it more comfortable in the cellar, because the activities of shelling ceases. It is a conservative estimate that there are 2 million flies in the place, ceaselessly buzzing about and crawling over the food. Upstairs, where the ration dump is, there are swarms of thousands of flies on each loaf of bread or other article that is not canned or covered. The odor is sickening. The room in the rear is full of mustard gas, which clings to the mattress, which is still on the bed and one's life is in danger if one stays there too long. No attempt is made to clean any part of the town. A little chloride of lime is really all that is necessary. I am anxious to get a bit of talcum powder or some such thing as an antidote against the odor. One o'clock and still no word of either Capt. McMurtry or the Lt. Lt Scott more dazed and reserved than ever. We decide that it is a good opportunity to make inquiries about the new disposition of the men on the hill and the whereabouts of the officers. A Boche plane up prevents me from venturing forth just yet. Wait a while. Instructions from Lt. Scott to bring back his bag and slicker if no one is where it was left, or in other words if the position has been abandoned. I am ready to go out, traveling without a rifle or anything that will hamper quick movement. Take with me two H Co. men, who have survived the gas attack and who wish to report to Batt. Hdqrs. and a machine gun man to establish liaison, if that is possible. Run the entire length of the village street to the church and then take a moment's shelter. Note new destruction wrought in the vicinity by last night's shelling. Many new shell holes. My companions are growing anxious about the distance they have to travel thus, and question if I know the road well. I am annoyed at their questioning and order them to follow me. Run across the open where no advantage can be taken of cover, then work my way up the hillside among the trees in a little orchard to the top of the first terrace where we must cross an open space of about 15 yds. The little spurts that are necessary in spots like these are what tire us so. We lie flat on the ground concealed by the row of bushes that crown the hillside, listening to the buzz of an aero motor high up. It is necessary to scold to procure silence, so that we can learn what kind of machine is up. Seems to me like a French plane. After a short rest we run across the field to the top of the next terrace, where there is another row of bushes and trees behind which to take shelter. We get there just in time to hear the ripping of a shell about to drop. Fall prone on the bank maintaining a goodly distance between us. The shell falls short, somewhere on the road. I do not turn to look where they strike. We are just within range of flying fragments. He sends four over and gives up a bad job having done no damage other than making holes in the earth. Assured that he is quiet for the time being, we make the next and last ascent bearing to the right to take advantage of cover offered by trees, which grow half way up the slope. No sooner seated to rest when on looking down through the trees on the bank there is to be seen the dead body of a man with a pack on his back. He does not show any evidence of having been badly hurt. Probably his death largely due to shock. Wedged between trees, which prevented him from rolling down into the flat. There is much L Co. equipment about. 10 yds. more to go to where we dug in last night, in the little hollow. I crawl continuously to the place, so that I do not risk injury to the men entrenched there, by being observed. No one is to be seen. I look for the spot where I began to dig. Doherty is not there. I shout guardedly for the men and officers without a response. Belts, guns and packs left behind. All evidences of a very hurried removal, but no suggestion as to where they might have gone. I see the little white bag in which I keep Leah's letters. I am incensed at 290Doherty for having left it behind, after I had taken the trouble to take with me his water pail which he had left in town, before I came up. My mess kit cover, which contains pictures and papers of value also left by him. Reconnoiter guardedly for about 10 minutes but find not a trace of the men who were there last night. Greatly worried about their safety and realize the futility of remaining where I am. I may be seen and fired at again. Look for the Lt.'s stuff and between myself and the machine gun man divide, as booty, some cigarettes and matches, leaving H Co. men to run the gauntlet of the open fields on their way to where they had declared it their intention to go. Make a hurried trip back to town, it being easy going down the slopes, halting only once when I hear a plane overhead. Back in the cellar, the Lt. is still moping, white as a sheet, lifeless, helpless. A... , one of our scouts comes to inquire for Griffiths, which makes the mystery of his disappearance still more baffling. No one comes with messages or official business, and presently when Nelson comes to invite me to stay with them for the night two doors below. The Lt. goes to the MG Captain's dugout for company, while I attend to a message to be sent there a short while later, at the same time letting Lt. know that I can be found if wanted, with the scouts, where I now go. Have a bit of salmon, buttered bread and water there. It is a much cleaner place than any other in town, there being less flies and a bedding of clean straw on the floor. I lie down, talk and discuss with the men the probable fate of the Capt. and Lt. They offer no encouragement whatever. Not an optimistic thought among them, and I rapidly work myself into a condition similar to that of Lt. Scott's, helpless. No one calls for me. No one stirs out of the place. The general opinion among the men is that it is best not to invite work in such dangerous surroundings. They will coast until sent for. Fritz sends a few series of shells distributed all over the countryside. Some come so close to our dugout that the effect on my nerves is extremely weakening. They whizz by so near that their passage fires a rush of hot air into the cellar. Along about nightfall I have occasion to go upstairs. I had intended to see if anything had been heard from the Capt. and the Lt. On reaching the head of the stairs, there comes the familiar ripping sound that is so much to be dreaded, a loud explosion and a shower of dirt goes into the cellar after me, almost partaking me in its flight. I lose all desire to attend to business. Better described by saying that duties do not exist. The only thing to do is to lie on my back and wonder why such a thing as the shell was ever invented. It gives a man no chance whatsoever for this life. It comes upon him unawares. He cannot fight against it. We settle ourselves for the night. Sleep and strange to say, make no arrangements whatever to post a gas guard. It proves unnecessary to be sure but there was a possibility, which should have been taken into consideration, that all of us would have fallen sound asleep. We sleep in fits and starts, there being always somebody awake. All of us cough and breathe heavily, complain about parched throats and smarting eyes, and when Fritz sends in his usual 12:10 barrage, we are prepared to adjust our gas masks hurriedly. Two or three big shells rack the place considerably, but do not disconcert us for we feel safe in the knowledge that our hiding place is strong and proof against shells. Many shells whizz, which do not explode, leading us to believe that gas is being sent over. Those of us who can still smell, sniff loud and long but discover no trace of gas, so we decide the wind is in our favor, blowing it away from us. Gradually we fall asleep and for an hour or so there is quiet. Another prolonged burst of shell fire, during which some of the men light cigarettes. I knock the matches from the hand 291of one man and scold everyone for carelessness under circumstances where each man depends for his life on the action of the other. The men attribute my display of aggressiveness to the fact that I am sick. For the rest of the night we are wary of the Hun's deadly gasses, without a guard.

Author: Grover Carter Date: 29 April 1918 Rank: Lieutenant Nationality: American Text: April 29, 1918 The Bosche began cannonading again at 3 a.m. Very heavy barrage. Also caught one of our batteries with his harassing fire. Had about 15 casualties, four killed. I went down at 4 a.m. & dressed all cases. All had plenty of gas and shells bursting all around. Came back to H.Q. at 8 a.m. Bosche has made several attacks on our front but has been driven back each time thus far. Still, very heavy cannonading going on.

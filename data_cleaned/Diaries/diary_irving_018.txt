Author: Irving Greenwald: Date: 19 April 1918. Location: At Sea in Danger Zone England. Nationality: Australian. Text: Friday April 19, 1918 Weather: Cloudy, Cold Health: Headache all day. At Sea - Danger Zone - In England Up at 6:00. On guard in boat 2A. Fearfully cold. A strong wind is blowing. Land is in sight to starboard. Five rocky promontories can be seen. Fleet riding close together. Must lie down in the boat to shelter from the wind. Have two pairs of gloves on hands. Still cold. Side of head gets full force of wind. Get out of boat to escape wind. Relieved at 8. Nothing sighted except flying fish. Leggings I brought up with me to dry on cable are missing. One of our men saw some one remove them but did not recognize him and cannot describe him. Go hunting for them but I cannot find a trace of the culprit. Tell Sergeant of my predicament. Advises me to take some one e1se's if I can find a pair. Consider that unfair. Would rather get scolding myself. Breakfast. Oatmeal, egg, bacon, coffee. Make another search for leggings. Find a pair on line which were probably those of man who took mine. They are size smaller but I manage to make them fit. Downstairs to roll pack amid great confusion. An inspection of company on deck after much excitement. Check taken on lost articles. Land much nearer now. Numerous mountains as far as the eye can see. Go back so far that they look like low hanging clouds against drab sky. Trawlers and fishermen numerous near coast. An outgoing convoy sighted. Object seen in distance which resembles a periscope. We watch it for a long time. Decide that if destroyer which passes it does not remark its presence we have been mistaken in our surmise. Remain on deck. Read and smoke till mess. Dinner, only edible part of which is pudding. Meat fat and tough as leather rejected by all. On deck again to look at land which appears to be same as that we saw two hours ago. Read and listen to supply company men gossip. Boat guard at 2:30. Boat drill taken off. Ship is out of danger zone. Cheering subdued. Port of Debarkation plainly in sight. A Half hour after guard is relieved, we pass within fifty yards of floating mine. Ships scurry to safety. One of them cuts sharply across our bow. All follow in single file. Ride in that formation until supper tine when they all slow down to await pilots. We are off again. Ship's name plate put up. Pilot and Captain hold an impromptu reception. Queer harborcraft, such as gas lightship and a side wheel steamer sighted. Cheering from passing ships. Destroyers leave us. We wait outside of bay for opportunity to enter inner harbor. A most wonderful beach in sight. A select summer colony on both shores. Houses all red brick and old tile roofs. Picture of symmetry and good order. People seen on shore through glasses. Anchor in river, too late to dock. Remain on deck until dark. Shivering from damp cold until I can no longer bear it. I go below to stand near to steam pipe for warmth. Mullin an escort, leading cheering and singing, American songs. Adjourn to hold. Dancing, games, horseplay. My headache begins with intensity. Lie around. Toss around until I manage to fall asleep. Wake up at 10:30, craving a drink of something hot. Coffee has been ordered by men playing cards and will be down shortly. Write a letter to Leah and Mama. Coffee comes. The best drink I ever tasted. Very hot. A perfect lubricant. Thoroughly warmed up. Quite comfortable now. Continue writing. Sandwiches come. I buy two. Good meat and jam. Up until 3:00. Feeling fine. Dream of home. A dangerous trip ended. I am pleased. Would very much welcome shore leave to look about town and city. Have utmost respect for British now. None but creators could plan such wonderful cities and keep such magnificent lawns. Wealth apparent on all sides. No evidence of hustle or hurry. People move about very cautiously at night. Curb lights in streets are out. Houses all darkened. River front shows only necessary lights.

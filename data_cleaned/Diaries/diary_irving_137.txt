Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 1 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Jul. 1, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good After breakfast- "Who will get flowers for our table?" I will. Beautiful roses across the street. I get some. Lt. G., "What are you doing with them?" "For our boudoir." "Nix. Gassed." Into the swill barrel. Up at 6:00 with a congested nose and head. It is a long tine since I have awakened thus. Wash up, feeling much refreshed. Breakfast in a most modern kitchen. The boys do not idle for a single moment. They have been out into the town and through the pottery and return with crockery. If we wish, we might have our meals served on china. Breakfast. Roast beef hash, Karo, coffee. Himpler out on special duty trying to locate Bandler and his squad, who are reported missing. Found by Himp and Captain who was anxious about men. Squad was lost in the night. Waited until the daylight to return. Our room is swept up, furniture moved about and put in order. Lt. means to take 5 men out to lines in wood on hill. I am in the detail. Fully armed. Lt. called to Hdqrs. by orderly with message as we are about to start. Cpl. Thurn takes charge. One aspect of new work that I like, is that when we go out it is not necessary to restrain my temper, because a noncom spends a half hour figuring how to get three men into a column of twos. We march as we please for greater safety. Halt a few minutes at end of town. French 75s are saying good morning to Fritz. Signs of very recent gas attack are evident. Shrapnel plentiful on road and embankment. Past ........ and into the hills. Up a very steep one, into the woods. See many new things in the zone. Protection always near at hand in numerous dugouts and funkholes. Defensive bombs, gas signals, etc. Meet Lt. to explain our mission to him. Cpl. takes half hour longer than necessary to do so. Got nervous listening to his chatter. Scene reminds me of picture of Hdqrs. in Civil War times, I have seen in the States. General at table in secured position. Private, orderly standing at respectful distance, delivering an incoherent message- in nine colors. Should be only 1 in white, pasty white, the color of our complexions. Start on a tour of the post. Miles of ditches cut through stone, dirt, tree roots, twisting in a bewildering maze. Boardwalks for flooring, where I expected to find none. A 196dizzy job to traverse the trenches, which are not in the pink of condition. Pretty well knocked about. They are deep enough in most places for us to walk erect without being seen above the parapet. Stores for various kinds of ammunition every few feet. Rockets, flares, etc. M.O's, bomb throwers, trench mortars ready for instant action. Woods in No Man's Land and for a considerable distance back of our lines is now nothing but ruin. Scarred stumps and trunks all that is left. Fallen branches present an almost impenetrable barricade against attack from either side. Poor observation to be had at the outposts, which we visit to familiarize ourselves with their positions, though their construction is very ingenious and represents a vast amount of labor. Well supplied with ammunition. Men are rationed on tinned stuff. They are by no means lacking in courage, though sadly deficient in the realization of the importance of their duties. Because nothing happens, they grow lax. They will get out of that shortly. At each one we rest while Cpl. Thurn gets on my nerves talking. At 11, I take off my belt for greater comfort. Thurn suddenly decides to go on. He is well acquainted with lines. To me they are like a jig saw puzzle. The only excitement we have had so far has been furnished by ourselves. We talk in whispers and imagine naive wonders. Stop at 12 to inquire about progress and observations made. None, Corp. Thurn takes a look but from a hole which is well concealed. Black looks over a parapet through glasses. Thurn, white as a sheet, excited beyond control, comes over to Black, pulls him down and commands us all to duck. He has seen two German snipers with guns leveled at Black. We look at each other, I believe, to see who is bravest. We see each other shivering. I am quaking in my boots. My heart is thumping so that I cannot breathe. Corp. takes a bomb. Black and Maloy who have snipers' rifles make an attempt to take a shot, provided Thurn can pick them up again through the glasses. We set our feet down on that. It would give us away. A Sgt. from 10 comes. When he hears the news, he is not anxious to stay. Cautiously we wend our way toward 10. It is hard to make our legs move. Look and listen. A most dramatic scene. Maloy looking through glasses and we, all ready to shoot, wait what seems an age. Nervous strain too great to stand. We do not know what is to our left, where there is a noise which sounds suspicions. It is best to go back. More theatricals. I am as frightened as any of them. Out on path with a great sigh of relief. I feel much lighter. I feel myself. A good reason why I am feeling free. My ammunition belt is not on my person. Consternation. I forgot to put it on then we left post 11. What am I to do? Nothing. Back to quarters, consoling each ether with "next time" resolves and post mortems. I haven't a damn thing to say. It is hard enough to be afraid without lying. An hour to mess time. I can find a tonic in my book, so I read. Mess. Hash, onion sauce, bread, coffee. Hungry enough to ask for more. Eat outside on a table in the garden. Read again until Lt. comes back and finishes his lunch. Announces detail for day because he must leave. Gillece and I ordered to ........ OP from 7 to 12. A good opportunity to write. Disturbed by a visit from Jerry's planes. At four I plan to bathe my feet. Go to the brook with my soiled clothes, which I will wash. An aeroplane buzzing around. Back to the kitchen for a dixie and filling it with water, I go back to the kitchen to do the job. Wash my clothes there too. Hang then to dry. Get a handful of forbidden fruit, currants. Supper is ready. Rice, bread, butter, coffee. Eat outside. Finished, I get ready to go on duty. Borrow a belt. Out with Gillece. As usual he asks a lot of questions, and wishes often that the Lord will permit him to kill a German. He is sober in spite of the fact that there were 5 canteens 197of red wine at home. I have asked Himpler to forbid him to drink any and he has succeeded in doing so. Arrive at post to relieve Farrell and Messinger without incident. Frenchy No. 1 is there. He is tired and goes out to parapet to take a nap. Left alone, I instruct Gillece in use of glasses and tell him where I think the German trench lines are. He looks for 15 minutes through glasses that are not focused. He is as bright as gunmetal tonight. I observe for a half hour or more straining my eyes uselessly. Do not observe any motion whatever, except from the crows. So it is, until it is too dark to see. No. 3, the silent Frenchman, comes and makes preparations for the night. Flaps down. Door curtains down. Candles lit. Frenchy wants to write. Tries to tell Gillece who looks at him with a most stupid stare. I explain. Frenchy writes. I study French, send Gillece outside. Machine gun fire heard, 4 or 5 bursts of it. There is more action than usual. Artillery on both sides working. French send over about 50 75's. Once an unusual series of reports. A mystery to us. On our reports we put it, in interrogatory form. From our right, where we saw Germans in the morning, three long bursts of fire with ???? Looks like E is getting action from Germans who are angered by Lt. Griffiths treatment of them in afternoon. He was out with Thurn with a rifle to verify Thurn's morning report. Sees three German snipers in camouflaged suits crawling around near our lines. He takes a crack at them. Result unknown because Thurn, who had the glasses on them, was so frightened by the report of the gun and flinches. Interesting to note down what I hear. Outside to look for flares, etc. It is pitch dark. We cannot see anything. Frenchman writes his letters. At 12 he leaves. I begin a letter to Leah. Wade comes with relief. I stop writing, wake up Gillece, who is asleep on chair on platform. Wade is drunk. Have difficulty in finding arms which I have left outside. It is too dark to see. Proceed by sense of touch. Wade leads. Cannot see where we are going. Shells come over. We wait to hear their whizz. Go on when we ascertain direction of travel. I think Wade is playing Wild West. It is, Pvt. Black whispers all the way in. Step high so that I will not stumble. Make for kitchen to look for coffee. None. Strike messes and make a lot of noise. Transport is in town. A ray of light from Lt's. window. He is still at work, soon sleeps. I go up to give him our reports. We talk it over for a half hour. He has made up a roster of our duties. Gillece and I are assigned to ........ in the future. Long shifts in our own platoon's sector. Work there will begin in the morning. Go to bed at 1:15. Read Terchy. Machine guns still going. Tonight window is open. Much more comfortable to sleep. Succeed very well in going about in the dark. Clothes on.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 7 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Tue. May 7, 1918 Weather: Raining, Cold Health: Good, Slight headache Up at 6:15. Arrive last on mess line. Served ahead of other men. Find time to fuss around in billets with ordering barracks bag and folding blankets, scraping mud from shoes, etc. Raining heavily. Men have started for drill in spite of it. A gun cover and can of oil issued to each man. Arrive at Batt. Hdqrs. rather late. Work all morning figuring payroll. Cold enough inside to warrant starting a fire in small stove, fuel soft coal. Warms place taking away chill. Dark in corner. Must work by candlelight. Strike many snags, account of indefinite remarks in explanation of reasons for back pay coming to men, deductions for fines, etc. Men come in dripping wet, complaining of inadequate protection our hats are against the rain. Think of men out drilling. They must be having a hard time of it. Work until 12. Go back to billets for mess kit. Sun is shining. Dinner. Boiled beef, potatoes, carrots, half portion of coffee. Report back for duty at 1. Men are wet through and in many instances it has been necessary to change for dry clothing. More cheerful in office in afternoon. Go to Mansion Hdqrs. at 4 to get dates and information in doubtful cases. On way meet man on a horse and leading another. Fox, who is with me, wants to ride horse not being ridden. Asks for permission which is gladly given. I continue walking. A few minutes later another enlisted man with two horses comes into view. Although I have never been astride a horse, I decide to ask permission to ride. Granted. I mount after a little difficulty, soldier making disclosure nag is blind. I wondered why horse had insisted on backing into ditch almost unseating me. Explanation found, I think it is best to continue leading my mount. This is done. Situation not much better. My horse runs into leader from behind and when leader begins to canter, my mount following, my back is almost broken from the jolting. I have no saddle or stirrups for support or comfort and nags back has a knife edge spine. Fearing I would be thrown or that I would become sore or lame, if I continued, I dismount and walk the remaining distance to destination. Meet Fox at crossroads. Have doubtful matters cleared up and return to billets in time for supper. Bully beef, bread, marmalade, coffee. Write until 8:30. Read newspaper until dark. Make bed and turn in. Men returning from village bring news that Capt. and Sgts. have returned from the front and are telling their experiences. They have been to Arras front, where they have worked with men in the trenches. Went out on patrol over the top. Stood by. Describe action. No man's land. Tell of bursting shells nearby, night raid, etc. A sickening sight they say, unnerving, yet one worth a thousand dollars to be permitted to witness. Would not give a nickel to return. Tell of comradeship of men they fought alongside of. All good fellows. Comradeship between officers and men. Saw men killed in action. Bayonet smeared with blood for 3/4ths of its length, with an inscription saying that it was revenge for three brothers of owner who were killed by Germans. A gruesome sight at the recollection of which our men shiver. Three British soldiers are arrested in the village for insolence to our officers. Retaliation for arrest of our men in St. O. Incessant artillery action throughout the day and night. Towards evening about 30 aircraft are observed flying high in direction of front. Learn that my being detailed to work at Battalion Hdqrs. was opposed by someone in orderly room. Lts. anxious to have me back with company to rejoin machine gun squad. They stop me when ever we meet on the road to ask me how long I will be away. A few cases of dysentery have made their appearance. Slight attacks. Men not permitted to drink water from town wells. Only water from carts in square to be used for filling canteens.

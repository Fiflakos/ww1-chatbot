Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. Jun. 15, 1918 Weather: Warm, Raining Health: Good Up at 5:45. A bugle blows somewhere at 5 o'clock. Our camp is astir. Go to sleep again, but disturbed by SOS making preparations to leave. Reveille. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Our American bacon does not compare with the British. Inspection at 8:00. My gun not in the best of condition. My personal appearance somewhat neglected. Lt. C. looks our platoon over. I feel assured that I will pass muster. He looks at me sharply for a second while I stare into space. Forgives me perhaps because he saw me at least make an effort to comply with standard while I worked the night before. We were out with packs, mine camouflaged, without shelter half, because it threatened rain. This led us to believe we were going out to drill and no greater surprise could be given to us than to hear Sgts. command "Dismissed". We could not believe our ears and voted our Army a fine institution. Plans were being made to spend the day as we fancied. A whistle blows which dissipates them all. Drill at 8:20. Sun is trying hard to come out and has partially succeeded. We go to a large hay field, newly cleared. March down road at attention. This is all new to me. Step is strange, gun on shoulder a new sensation. Resigned to what is before me. I will do my best and pay strict attention. Close order drill on field. Company split into three sections, one of which continues with close order. Two work out a problem in formation for attack, approved by our COs. Some of our men have had a little of it, at last station where I overheard some conversations on the subject, which led me to believe it was a very complex one. I do not find it so. I readily get into the swing of it. A long rest period, lying prone on the ground to be ready for the call to attention, because Major is expected. My interest lies in watching farmer in adjoining field cutting hay with an American mowing machine. One of his horses has its ears painted red and a fancy headpiece, probably for protection against flies. Non-coms now take platoons for combat formation drill until 11, then a half hour of close order drill. Company can be excelled by a lot of rookies who have the proper spirit. At half past eleven mess line is formed, but mess is not ready until 12:30. I write in the meantime and find a place in the line through the favor of Reilly. Dinner. Canned roast beef, boiled potatoes, coffee, bread. Back again to the Upton days, when I had more to eat than I cared for. Lt. announces mail will be accepted in afternoon. Formation at 2:30, with packs at rifle range. It begins to rain at 1. Tents ordered put up. Men dig trenches around tents. I, who have put in raindays at .......... and found that an unnecessary precaution, have time to write. Rubin comes in. Disturbs me. 2:30 goes by. No orders. 3 oclock is the hour set. Men wait and argue with the 1st Sgt. It is madness to go out in the rain. Orders are orders. F Co. returns from range. Their Lt. advises we stay home. He is heard with favor. A wild cheer at dismissal. Free for day. Continue with letter to Nuck. I rewrite it often. Twice, because rain drops blot paper, so that it looks as if I were crying. Once, on account of error. Rubin reads a few items from his diary to me. Charmed with them. A description of a sunrise and a sunset while at sea. I mail a letter to Leah and to Mama. Supper. Canned salmon, potatoes, tea, bread. Debate advisability of leaving some for later. Get a piece of chocolate. Write. It has stopped raining, I have been in my tent most of time since arrival. l will go out for a walk to stretch my legs. Will look for some chocolate which I long for. Get no further than 25 ft. up the road when I see a man picking cherries from a tree in private grounds. If he can, without being disturbed, why not I? Delicious, ripe red sweet berries. Handfuls. A privilege to pluck then. A privilege granted by God. After a while take even partly ripe berries. Try a few from another tree. I am full to bursting. Go up the road midway between two villages to look at a picture from the road. Woods for a background from left to right. Village, orchard, a field of green, one brown patch, an enclosed cemetery, field, orchard, village. A glow of splendid gold all over by the setting sun. I would go out but I have writing to do. Wash leggings. In tent to write. Rations wagon comes in and our cook who has been to hunt up extra blanket rolls. He has his. For me he brings only raincoat which has sheltered him. Yes, he has seen mine. In a bundle in an open field wet by rain. I must go for it tomorrow surely. I want Leah's letters. Our men have returned from schools. Some from hospital too. Lt. and Sgts. having a discussion on best methods to kill with a bayonet. Make bed. Tent is very dry in spite of rain. Rubin is talkative. So am I. There is a world of things I want to say. Rubin goes to see a friend in another street. Lt. Cook scolds men who come in or walk about after taps, which has just been sounded, so Rubin is trapped and sleeps with three other men where he visits. I wait and go to sleep at once, while I say my prayers for Leah and the end of the war to come. Not a sound of strife except for reports from rifle range. It rains again during the night. I must get out once.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 26 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Fri. Jul. 26, 1918 Weather: Fair, Rain Health: Good Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Bread, Karo, coffee. Doughnuts, 4 of them by a ruse. I am caught at it but not scolded. After breakfast, wash, shave, walk up to Battalion Hdqrs. to talk to some of the boys, whom I see standing around, and I am called by Lt. Griffiths. He hails me 3 or 4 times, before I am aware that he wants me, and then I must be told by the men. He wants to know whether I have had a good time in ........ yesterday and if I had time enough to do all I wanted to. Of course I have. He wants to give me a pass for Saturday also and wants me to take advantage of it. Think it a good opportunity to mail my packages at the railroad. Thank him and promise to ask for a pass to-morrow. In quarters, begin to write. Sgt. Kirchner announces a formation. Everybody will go with him to patrol by daylight over territory to be gone over to- night. The problem before us tonight will be to get by F Company's sentry in dark. We go out in three or four sections. All present but two men. We follow railroad to a French camp, going down hill. Lose the path. Ask our way, and are put right by the French. Come upon a most beautiful spot. A farm house and farm in the heart of the woods. A natural clearing, surrounded four sides by the woods, level as a 241billiard table with a lake and a bath house at eastern end. Is this war? Hardly. We sit down on the banks of the lake, pick huckleberries and raspberries and those who are inclined to, undress and go for a swim. Deep and cold. Excellent swimming. I wish that I could go in too, but rash on my foot prevents me from bathing. Lie on the grass on the banks, talking about how people pay money for a vacation like to-day's and how remarkable that soldiers can lie as peacefully as this. Fifteen minutes from the front line trenches is a spot which war has never touched and probably never will, it is so sheltered. The cackle of hens and the crow of roosters can be distinctly heard from where we are. I take my ease, lying on my stomach in the sun. I would like to lie there for the rest of the day. Angry when the Sgt. calls us to go back. A warm climb up the hill. Five minutes' walk hides the lake and farm from view completely. Shortly after, we get back, mess is ready. Write in the meantime. Dinner. Steak, squash, bread, coffee. Plenty of seconds. Write again until we are ordered out to report to office. Lieut. wants everybody to go out to the different posts to familiarize themselves with the positions and the roads which lead to them. Kirchner, Thurn and the Lt. each take out a party. I am with the Lt. We go to where Capt. Brooks had his Hdqrs. in the woods. A pleasant walk. Lt. converses with us. At the barracks he stays to talk with Lt. Blackwell for half an hour. Schlesinger and I talk about Capt. Mills, while we wait for the return trip. It looks like a shower coming up. Catches us on the road at an ammunition dump. From there we must run a half mile in the open to a dugout. An old gun emplacement handier. We find shelter there for all. Gun is gone but there are at least 800 75 shells in the racks, powder and all other accessories to artillery. Interested enough to ask a lot of questions most of which remain unanswered. Meet some of the advance party of the Division. Scouts and engineers. Quite wet. Rain stops in ten minutes. Go back by a different road and when we are dismissed we are cautioned to remain near our quarters to be in readiness to assemble at 8:45 for patrol formation. Write until supper. Excellent beef stew, bread, coffee. Write again till I am finished. Make an effort to pack up laces to mail home. Have five empty tobacco tins, get paste from Tallon at Battalion Headquarters and go to Lt. Griffiths' shack to work. He is not in, so I do nothing, for I want to show him the laces I have bought before I wrap them up. While waiting for him to come in, I write a letter to Mama, which keeps me busy till it is time to go back to barracks for roll-call. Sgt. calling out names. I am able to answer present. The party is destined not to go out. Two officers, breathless, hatless and perspiring are with Lt. Griffiths, telling him of a most regrettable accident, which has just occurred. Capt. Mills and a number of others were demonstrating and practicing with rifle grenades, when one exploded prematurely in the cup, blowing off part of Capt. Mills face and the arm of Johnson, the company mechanic. The Capt. is in bad condition, unconscious and breathing hard. His life is despaired of. Only thing that can be done for him is to make him as comfortable as possible. The camp is all upset. We are shocked beyond expression. Officers and orderlies running about in search of doctors and medical men. Groups all over camp trying to learn particulars of accident from G. Co men, who are on official errands. Johnsons arm will have to be amputated. He is remembered by all as a fine fellow. Major busily engaged in calming others down and making arrangements for Capt.'s removal to ........ for treatment. Lt. Griffiths only one remaining at Battalion Headquarters, so it is doubtful if the patrols go out. We are told to wait 15 minutes or so till it is finally decided what to do. In the 242meantime, we discuss the many accidents which have occurred in the regiment. It is as much a matter of wonder as it is of regret. Again the question is put "Are we fit to fight?" Again the answer is "No". Reminiscences of Capt. Mills, picturesque, lovable qualities. There is hardly a man in the regiment who did not know and like him. Sgt. returns to tell us that we will not go out to-night. All G. Co men with us are sent to their company to get whatever information they can about condition of Capt. for Lt. Griffiths. Rest of us go to bed. I look through my OD and undershirt for cooties. Find a nest of them in both shirts, after a diligent search, which lasts for half an hour. Then I go to bed. Tallon comes in to disturb me as usual. Hardly half an hour after I have cleaned out my shirt, I feel the vermin crawl over my neck again, in my trousers too. Scratch myself to sleep. In spite of the air of sadness among the men, some of them tell stories as on previous night. G. Co men come in after 11 to report that Capt. Mills has been removed to Base Hospital at ........ His condition is unchanged. Recovery very much in doubt. The late comers light candles to make their beds by. Sounds like a Boche plane overhead. Boys are nervous and argue that the light should be put out at once. No one obeys. They stay lit until they are no longer needed. One or two of the big guns in the woods bark at about this time. That and a few other shots fired during the day, only activity. Practice machine gun firing among the French.

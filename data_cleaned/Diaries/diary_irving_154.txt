Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 18 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Thu. Jul. 18, 1918 Weather: Raining, Hot Health: Good Throndsen calls me at 7. I have breakfast of six or seven pancakes, syrup, bread, jam, coffee, eggs. Take a rest and smoke a pipe, home style before I go to work. For water, and on my way back take a handful of wood, bit supplies for Eddie and manage to get more wood. Wash the dishes, sweep the floor in both kitchen and dining room, clean tables, refill hot water tank and my day's work is practically done. Think it is a good plan to wash towels and a few napkins. If the officers eat so well, they should have napkins, which can be procured so easily. They are not much soiled. It will be an easy matter to wash them. I do that including a tablecloth among the linens, quite a large one. I have my doubts if I will be able to accomplish the feat. With good hot water, I quickly make a passable job of them, rinse wash in cold enter and am ready to hang out for drying. A shower comes up again. There has been a heavy one from 7 to 8, which has wet everything, and now it seems as if it will rain all day. At any rate, my duties for the morning are finished. 1, 2, 3 heavy explosions in the direction of the lines. There is only the shortest possible hiss before the shell is detonated. Seems to me like Fritz is sending them to the boys in the front line. I stop work, sit on the window sill to listen in which direction they are going. Decide it is our guns shelling some very close position within the enemy lines. That ends the hostilities in the morning, with the exception of aeroplanes up observing shellfire. To my room to write by the windows. I have a chair, the sill is my table and I look out upon one of the most beautiful rose bushes in the world. It is a big one, almost a tree, trained to spread out like an umbrella. There is a little more fuss than usual attendant upon dinner. Get water for the Captain's bath at 12. He does not get out of bed until 12:30. Takes a long time to perform his ablutions. Late in getting downstairs. Dinner is steak, French fried potatoes, onions, peas, currant pie, tea. I broil my steak on a little griddle, which has been found in one of the closets, and make one of the tastiest morsels of meat I have ever eaten. There is work to do serving and running errands until 3:30, after which I wash the dishes, sweep the floor, etc. until 4:00, at which time I am off for the afternoon. Write for half an hour, finishing work at hand and take a nap. No one disturbs me until 6:00. Have had an excellent nap. I get up of my awn accord when I hear shells by the hundreds going up towards Germany. What I cannot understand is why I hear no reports. They sing along "Wheeee, Wheeee" and all that can be heard, when it is naturally expected their journey is at an end, is an occasional shell sound. I wonder whether these are gas shells that are being sent. I heard something this morning that gas of American manufacture was being used with telling effect. It is of such strength that it eats leather. Also hear that 1800 Germans were taken prisoners by our boys. So, I wonder if this can be more of that gas to take advantage of a wind that is in our 227favor and promises to be for the rest of the day. It is a mournful sound to hear. One that suggests suffering that goes with it. I lie in bed for a matter of five minutes or so, but I must get up. That sound is getting on my nerves. Supper will be served shortly, for 4 as usual. At the last minute company comes, Captain Handy, to look over positions which he takes over. Throndsen goes up in the air. It is still worse when another Lt. comes. There are now prospects that the servants get no supper. They do away with all the potatoes, leaving for us some of the best meat I ever tasted, peas, prunes, tea, bread and jam. All this was much delayed. After officers are done, Capt. sends for me. Asks me how I feel. OK. He has been directed by Rgtl. authority that I am to be put to work outdoors. He wants me to get my arms and follow him to his new hdqrs. I see that he is in trouble of some kind regarding me, so I consent. Finish my supper, called for again, to tell me that I must move and when I return there is some ammunition to be carried. I do not like the prospect. I finish some prunes and tea and put all my things into my shelter half and move up to the chateau, where the boys are, which is disagreeable in the extreme and which so far I have been fortunate to avoid. I make the best of it. I will obey orders and complain afterward. I am dreadfully worried about the consequences. I like the Capt., wonder how Rgtl. Hdqrs. got to know about me and put it down to the letter I wrote to Leah about the Englishman in which I probably said something to which exception was taken and for which I shall have to pay dearly. Dreadfully sad about it. I, the Papa of Cecilie, a prisoner, first to shield another and now because he has committed a sin. I do not know what to do. If I refuse to take punishment, I will be dealt with severely. Can I ask Leah and Cecilie to do without me to save my honor? I decide that I cannot. It is better that I suffer degradation than make them suffer for an instant. Not if I love them will I refuse to accept punishment. I get a bunk in the hall upstairs. Go back for the things I left. Told we may rest for the night. That is good. Stay apart from the men by sitting on my bed to go through my letters to see if there is any further reference made to my condition in them. I do not like the tone of any of them and tear up two of them. There is no time to rewrite them tonight. Burn the scraps carefully. My imagination now places me in the middle of an international scandal. I go about it as though everything about me would be examined for evidence that will prove I am a spy or some such criminal. I am truly in a panic. I do not know what I am doing or what brought it all about, when I finally remove my things and go to bed with a feather mattress, which I found in the next room, as bedding underneath. It is just as good as no covering at all over the heavy wire network. My side, back and ribs are sore, sore from sleeping on the bars, stops the circulation of the blood. I cannot sleep. As I say my prayers, the order comes for everybody out to carry ammunition. I decide to feign sleep, but in a minute I change my mind. I must be honest now of all times, since I ask a favor of the Lord. I get up at once, go downstairs with the others. When we are most of us assembled, the order comes not to mind but to go back to bed. I remain awake for another smoke and to be alone with my unbearable thoughts. Oh how it hurts Leah's husband and Cecilie's papa to be a prisoner in disgrace. My head bursts from thinking and brooding.

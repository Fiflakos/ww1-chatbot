Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 22 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Jul. 22, 1918 Weather: Fair, warm Health: Good Hike to ........ alone. Up at 7:00. Breakfast. Rice and raisins, bacon, bread and coffee, no milk. Wash, make bunk. Get ready to go to the grave of Harry Schneider. One of the men tells me he has been there and directs me to where his grave lies. On the road to my old OP, a spot I have passed many times. In the little military cemetery opposite .......... So long since I have been down that way that things seem to have changed and grown older. Three aeroplanes up directing artillery fire, which seems to consist of gun shelling in German back area. As I near cemetery, Germans open fire on planes with high explosives. I duck into the lone barn on the right of the road for shelter from falling shrapnel. When planes are out of range, shelling ceases, giving me an opportunity to get up gently sloping hillside to cemetery. I have a hard time locating the new graves. Almost give up hope of finding them when I think of looking extreme right, last row. There are 14 new graves, 12 with crosses at the head, two with a rounded top marker board. No. 13 is Harry's. I step between some graves to get near enough to read the inscription on the board and the identification tag. It is Harry Schneider, Died June 24. Go to the foot of the grave, stand at attention and ask the Lord to rest his soul in peace. He was a good lad, loved his country and loved his mother. The planes overhead were within range and, as I say my prayer, the enemy fires a salute for the glorious dead, in the air high above as. Turn back immediately. I have left word that I would be back in a few minutes, in case I was called for. Expecting a runner from E would start for ........ after his breakfast and by now should be there. Back in quarters. No one has 234been looking for me. My eyes are tired. They can only be rested by sleep. I take a nap until mess time. Have to. Must give up attempt to write more of Leah's letter. Postpone that till after dinner. Good beef stew with lots of tomato in it, bread, black coffee. Take a chance on putting a pair of socks and a towel to dry before any one calls for me and I wash them at the pump. Go to the guard house for some ink. Three of the boys are there writing. There is very little ink to be had. Back to write until I am sent for. Appears that I have been forsaken and abandoned to the mercies of D Co. At four 1st Sgt. calls to tell me I should have been working all day, since nobody has come for me. I am not yet dispatched to my organization and properly receipted for. Lucky I do not get an extra month on the work platoon. Other boys, he says, who have kept in hiding all day to avoid work, will receive that punishment, he tells me. Sends me to find as many of them as I can locate. Go to guard house to get those men I have seen there. On my way there, meet Greek Corporal who has already routed them out. Report and am ordered to roll my pack, and report to orderly room in charge of runner. Busy as once. Takes me long to roll pack. When ready am escorted up the hill into the woods by Mahon. Hotter than blue blazes. Sweat like the devil. Wet from head to foot. Rest once, little more than midway between town and headquarters. Arrive there, remove pack, told to wait. For a half hour I sit down doing nothing. Cannot finish my interrupted letter to Leah. Nothing to read, so I take Leah's letters again, something I had reserved for a few days later, Asked my name, number, etc., so that 1st Sgt. could make out a receipt for me. Everybody is acquainted with the fact that I am a prisoner. Much questioning and laughter at my expense. Grind my teeth in rage, while outwardly I smile. I will be sent to Battalion Hdqrs., where I can be sent further if my destination calls for any further movement. First I will have mess, which I wait for about 15 minutes. More stew, without potatoes, bread and black coffee. On my way through the woods to ......... with an orderly. Hot walking. Rest once for 10 minutes on the road. Arrive at Batt. Hdqrs. to find great changes have been made. Penfield, Nichols and Fish have been commissioned and office is in charge of acting Co. Clerks. They do not know what to do with me. Ask for Lt. Griffiths. He is eating. I see him and other officers at a table. Wait out of sight until he is finished. In meantime see Tallon. He tells me I will be court-martialed. He had made out the charges yesterday. Begs me to tell all I know. I walk around and to my surprise, who do I see but the boys playing pitch and toss outside of barracks door. "Hello Greeny". Oh God. I get a royal welcome. My hand is wrung, my back is slapped. I am lugged by Wade. I am mighty glad to see the boys together. Glad to be with them. They have been resting since they left ........, doing nothing connected with company work. Doherty and a Sgt., some Pvts., new additions to the detachment. Back to the office to see Lt. Griffiths. When he is finished, I stand where he will notice me easily. He is surprised and glad to see me. Comes to me, wants to know how I am, and tells me he was looking for me with company since yesterday. Takes me to barracks. Johnnie Himpler has a bunk ready for me. Lt. takes my mail, promises to get it off for me quickly. Ask him about my pay and other things. Everything will be attended to for me. Tells me to do nothing but rest up. Himpler tells me I need a haircut and promises to give me one tomorrow. Games stop, boys gather around me to hear of my experiences while away. From Lt. I heard that Stewart had died in the hospital from wounds. Shocking. Hold court, telling all I know about the shooting, other accidents, activity, while in town, present status of the lines, my experience in the ........ 235road, etc. A dozen men or more around me and every once in a while another comes in and interrupts to shake hands and tell me how glad they are to see me back. Talk until it is dark, light candles and continue until Lt. orders all lights out. A scramble to make bunks. Boys are all lousy. Warn me not to lie in hay. Full of vermin. Tallon comes in. Give him part of my bunk. Must postpone writing until to-morrow. To bed at 10:30. Boys keep up a story-telling contest. Besides scouts, the battalion runners are quartered with us. They come in late after a hard day's work, as a rule, and want to sleep. There is so much noise that they cannot sleep. An argument and a fight starts as usual. Scouts are pretty mellow and in excellent humour as is usual when they rest. At 11:30, it quiets down. Plenty of snoring, lots of rats under and on the bunks. I cannot sleep. Bed is hard and I imagine I itch. At 1:30, a big gun in the woods goes off. It wakes me entirely. Another and another until it assumes the proportions of a modified barrage. The noise wakes up one, then another. Men get gas masks and hold them in readiness. We are all awake by now, wondering what is going on. Nothing can be seen, but flashes. No one gets out of bed. Lie awake trying to tell from the sound where the gun is and what is its caliber. About a half hour of fierce action. I am told there are about 600 guns in these woods all around us. Everybody knows that in ten days we move. Four places favored.

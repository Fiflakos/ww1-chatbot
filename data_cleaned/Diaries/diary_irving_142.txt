Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 6 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sat. Jul. 6, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Poor F Co. to make a raid to-night with the aid of French. E Co. platoon comes up in support. 4 letters from Leah - one from Annette Up at 7:00. Wash. Breakfast. I wonder what will happen to me. Nothing further has been said about my undergoing punishment. I know that Lt. is trying his best to get me out of the scrape I am in, and silence on his part, leads me to believe he has found a way to comply with the spirit of the order without punishing or degrading me. I cannot find interest or enjoyment in anything. I am not feeling well. My digestion is poor. I have cramps and symptoms of dysentery, which together with the disgrace which stares me in the face make me wish to close my eyes and forget my troubles in sleep if I can. Lie down and fall asleep. Awake at 12. Go to dinner. Meat balls, potatoes, tomato sauce, bread, coffee. A feeling of fullness and heaviness in spite of the fact that I eat very little. Lt. has not yet come back. My fate is still in doubt. Best to take a walk to avoid hearing any disagreeable news. I will go to the pottery. Meet Sgt. Byrne there, who tells me he has had experience in the potter's craft. Explains different stages of manufacture of plates to me. Stroll around in the various buildings looking for finished pieces suitable for sending home as souvenirs. A wonderful place at one time, now in ruins. Thousand of pieces of crockery, most of them broken or cracked. Some baskets of good ones from among which I pick a few pieces which suit my fancy. See infants' bath tubs, which remind me forcibly and painfully of my loved ones at home. I think of the baby I have at home and have never seen and realize what a fool I was not to have gone home to see her before I left. Not a new thought with me lately, but a futile one, I realize. Find a willow wired cane an my way out. I think it may belong to one of the men billeted in quarters here, pass it by, then turn back to get it. Boys in quarters when I get back admire both my cane and the pottery I bring back. A number of them seized with the impulse to go there and do as I did, leaving me almost alone and giving me the opportunity to write a letter to Leah without being disturbed. There is not much paper. Borrow as much as I can. Tell Leah about the bath tubs. Write to Bella, Willie, and begin a letter to Lottie. Supper. Meat balls, spaghetti, bread, coffee. Stomach feels a little better. Lie down for a moment's nap. I have been asked to go with Gillece to Hdqrs. to stay for the night and bring back report of activities, if any. This pleases me more than any detail I have so far been given for it signifies I am reinstated into the good 206graces of the Major and am still a Battalion Scout in good standing. To myself I thank Lt. Griffiths for intersession in my behalf. Happy and pleased as punch. An example of how good news cures ills. Lie contentedly, smoking in bed, when discussion arises on what day of the week it is. I have imagined all day that it was Friday and was enjoying the last smoke before Sabbath was ushered in. Convinced that to-day is Saturday, I feel awfully sorry that for the first time since I made my promise to Leah not to smoke on the Sabbath, I have broken it. Unconsciously, to be sure, but nevertheless I feel badly about it. Material for another letter to Leah to-morrow, in which I will ask for forgiveness. Observe what is left of the Sabbath, about an hour and a half. Prepare to go to H Hdqrs. Take cane as supplementary weapon. Get a sandwich in the kitchen to have at hand in case I grow hungry in the night, as was the case while on last job of this nature. Get the password. Start while it is light. Beyond the town the smell of mustard rising from the damp ground. Quite sure it is that. Gillece disagrees. Another argument with him about the road we should take. This time he proves to be in the right. Made as welcome as the accommodations permit by the men on guard and patrol duty. Hdqrs. is outside under a shed. Dugouts and boyaus on left of road. Talk to whoever is arriving for purpose of getting whatever information I can from them. Caution them about talking to ....... officers, who are spying in this sector. They tell me of the exploits of Capt. Mills and a French Lieut., who went over the top from 18 post, where we have spent so much time in observation, going down into the gully, to the spot we had reported to be a new line of trench. They make no attempt to conceal movement and encounter no one. Supposed line of trench is a road and shell holes in No Man's Land. That is a bit of gossip that pleases me, for it discredits Thurn, who, every time he goes to that post to observe, sees from 1 to 12 Huns, houses, MG emplacements, etc. I was almost certain he uses his imagination instead of his eyes. Now I am sure. Ask for officers, so that I may report presence to them. Ushered into the presence of Capt., and Lt. Otto, whom I snubbed yesterday. They are in good humour and joke with us, while they instruct us of intended movement in event they must retreat under heavy shelling or gas attack. Follow non-com into adjoining dugout, where we can get a bit of sleep if we wish. Bunks are without straw on the customary wide mesh springs. Only a board bottom. Place smells of dump and vermin. Suggestive of rats. No one asleep as yet. Most of the men are sleeping out in the open, but it becomes too cold and damp for them. They come in one by one for warmth and cover. Artillery behind our lines is very busy. Shells are whizzing above us frequently and sound is quite audible from where we are. I should have gone out to investigate, but I am assured it is nothing of importance. Bursts of firing lasting about 10 minutes at a time. .......... M.G Fire - But no activity in sector I am covering. Lennon comes in. We talk. Remove belt and helmet. Lie down on bench which has served as my chair. The hardest thing I have ever slept on. Sorry now that I have not chosen one of the bunks while they were still to be had. Men are awakened who are to go on visiting patrol. I get into place vacated by them. Heavy shelling at 12 o'clock to our right. Fritz is active too. ......... and ........ are being shelled with .. and gas. I wonder what our detachment is doing. From sound, they are in zone of fire. Probably in the dugout. Sleep a little in my perch. Must get out when men come back. Place I have vacated has been taken by a member of company, so I am without a bunk. Sit on opposite bench, too narrow to sleep on, and bethink myself of finishing letter to Lottie. Light and position too poor for that and 207instead want to clean and oil my revolver. It is loaded. I extract cartridge, and interested in method of ejection, I load and unload. When I have seen enough of workings, I release magazine and pull trigger. Bang! The bullet buries itself in the flooring without injury to anyone. E Company brilliancy. Sure death to someone had muzzle not been pointed to floor. Look unconcerned. Scolded by men but no one gets excited.

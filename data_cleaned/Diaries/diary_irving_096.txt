Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 20 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Mon. May 20, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Cecilie's pictures come to me. Up at 6:00. Breakfast. Bacon, very salty, which is responsible for an all day thirst, bread, coffee. Air blankets, wash. Wait to be called by scouting party at 7:30. Lts. bring with them a great many instruments in which are compasses of every make. Into the woods where our open air class meets. Group ourselves around instructors. Shown methods of using and manner of using different kinds of compasses. Use of map making instruments explained. Shown how to draw maps for military purposes as distinguished from ordinary ones. Given a lesson in map reading, finding direction and given points by compass, both in day and night. Use of maps for direction. Lt. has very poor material to work with. Bark of a large tree is our blackboard, no resting board or thumbtacks for drawings and sketches. Scaling of maps, distances obtained by foot pacing. Each man's pace differs, we must have each member's pace measured for this purpose. Lt. goes back to town for a tape. Meanwhile we take readings with pneumatic compass. Returns with tape. Go to main road, pace off 400 yds. Length of stride is 67 and one half inches. Captain and Colonel's adjutant come along to tell Lt. that he is wanted to meet an officer at 1 o'clock, at a distant crossroad, with two of his best scouts. I was hoping that I would be one of two selected. Broadhead and Sgt. Fisk asked to go. Disappointed. Left with one instructor. We take a compass reading for accuracy of two points in different directions. Then make a map of road we are on. Simple. Back for mess. Told we will be prepared to go out tonight at 9 for patrol work, for which we must all secure compasses, from our respective supply Sgts. Promised early dismissal in afternoon. Write on return to billets. Mess. Beef stew, hardtack, coffee. Take an hour's nap in a shady spot in field. Out at 1:30. Lt. takes us to field across the road from where we will work tonight to permit us to study the ground. Trial of 4 men patrolling so we can get an idea of nature of work. Dismissed after a half hour's rest while we ask questions. To report at 9:00 with full equipment. Ask supply Sgt. for compass. Mail is in. Corp. Haight finds 6 letters for me. I open first one on road. Lie in field to read remainder. In the second I find pictures of Cecelia, taken in three positions. Leah in bed, looking fine God bless her, holding baby, Mama in rocker with baby and baby alone. First is best. Cecelia's beauty shows to best advantage. I am very happy. Contented to see baby as though I had seen her in the flesh. All Leah's letters contain good news, Thank God. I kiss baby, Leah, Mama, innumerable times. At once write a letter to Leah. While I write a bird lights on tree above me and quite plainly says, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy". I tell Leah about it. Glad I am alone. Company returns. Retreat without me. An inspection of equipment and feet without me. Lt. excuses me. Move to position in hot sun out of way. Mess. Bread, jam, coffee. I get an early supper, before men. Finish letter. Write until 9:10. Sgt. brings me a compass. I show Cecelia's picture to those worthy of looking at her. Formation at 9:19. Brilliant moon. I wonder how a scout can prevent being seen on such a night. When I arrive, Lts. are in estaminet bargaining with Madam for eggs and bread for sandwiches when we return. She has bread but not enough eggs. Get enough from neighbor to satisfy our needs. We explain we want sandwiches. I am called upon to interpret. Laughed at. A poor French student. Finally I understand lady has no fire to fry with. Try neighbor, another and another, but no one can accommodate us. Decide to cache supplies and pick up on our return trip. At field, divided into two parties. Object, learn what is the condition of enemys wire, enemy patrols if any, etc. Conway, Himpler, Black go out. Another party around hedge. Three men on guard, observing, listening. I am second relief on latter. Patrol goes out in bright moonlight. An occasional flare far distant. They creep. After a few minutes I lose sight of them, after which I cannot see a soul in the No Mans Land, to my great surprise. Too much creaking and noisemaking equipment on us. I relieve guard. Look through glasses until my eyes are sore, but still have located no one. Occasionally imagine I have found them but I see only shadows. No sound. Lt. and next relief pass same as I. Exercise should be over at 11:30. It is later and no one returns. We go to look for them. A hard job finding them. When two parties assemble to compare notes, we find that no man saw enemy except on one occasion. A most interesting night's work. A hard one for men who have been patrolling. Caked with mud and wet through from dew. An occasional airplane overhead. Once think we hear a bomb explode. See a bright pilot light for planes. Very little artillery action at front. See a few flashes and rockets. Three of our scout party lost. Wait until they are found. In the interval we take a smoke and are taught how to locate the north star. March back to village, picking up bread and eggs on wayside before I get to my billet. Kiss baby and undress. Get into bed without disturbing anyone, at 12:30. Get a good and well- deserved night's rest. Plan to find forget-me- nots to enclose in letter to Leah.

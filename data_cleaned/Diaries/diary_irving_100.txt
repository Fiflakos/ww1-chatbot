Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 24 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Fri. May 24, 1918 Weather: Raining, Chill Health: Good Up at 6:00. Lt. does us the honor. Bathe feet in wet grass. Go for wash and to fill bottles. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. It begins to rain, a fine drizzle at first which grows in strength. Lt. gives us a little of long discarded physical exercises, the hardest ones in the book. They hurt my stomach and back. Lt. undetermined whether to take us out until he sees a party of English come up for shooting on the range. If they can, we can, so out we go. Try to hint loud enough for officer to hear that men from 1st Battalion are still in tents. Have not stirred out of them except for breakfast. Purpose is to reconnoiter wiring. I am given same stretch of wiring as yesterday. Conway to assist me. Our task shorter than that of balance of men. Therefore we will help cooks get water. Start for farmhouse. Rain grows stronger. It is pouring now. Fortunately we are protected by slickers. They are inefficient. No protection for knees. Hats a nuisance. Water trickling down my neck. No water to be had. Having two missions it is for us to decide which to finish first as being more important. We think water for coffee is more necessary. We wait in keepers lodge until it is possible to get water. I sit in a real chair sheltered from the rain and take a nap and a smoke. It is 10. Grow afraid of scolding from Lt. for laxity of duty. In spite of heavy rain we fill dixies and cans with water. Put three dixies on stick, a proceeding which proves ridiculous. Too heavy. I take one in each hand. Stopping frequently across long stretch of muddy pasture I manage to reach kitchen with them, but only after I have reached the opinion that I will never again be able to use my arms. Men are back in tents as we arrive, which is an example for us to do likewise without having covered our assignment at all. Try to dry and warm my clothes. Of no avail. Tent begins to leak badly in middle, on sides. It is very damp and cold in house. Change my socks and shoes for new ones, never worn. Nap as well as I can until mess time. A projected stew changed to bully beef a la scout, coffee, bread, dates. It cannot be eaten outside. Both of us crowd into tent. Very uncomfortable while eating. Warmth of coffee helps me back to good humour and compensates for discomfitures. I have managed to dry knees a little, standing by fire. Write a letter. It clears long enough to permit us to go to farmhouse, for lesson in compass readings and, map references, in a garret, by climbing a ladder and crawling through a hole in the wall, on a flooring of brick, without support underneath. Rocks dangerously. Not interested in lecture. I am out of circle and cannot hear well, because of hammering from below. It sounds like a stage being constructed. I would like to investigate. Get a chance to steal downstairs. Sure enough. The limber loads of property and a sign announcing a vaudeville. London Music Hall stars. Willy Reeve, Morton, 5 other 1st magnitude actors. A piano is there already. I must go. Supper. Beer stew, hardtacks, coffee, is delayed. Ready to go up to theatre. Lt. interrupts. Cooks want water. It must be had. We will get some, bring it back after the show. Very well. No admission fee is charged. Crowded house. Electric light, balcony, men on rafters. Whole company on stage, ensemble act. Strange how it resembles New York vaudeville. Dirty tired soldiers for audience. Straw hats, full dress suits, plug hats, canes, boutonniers, silks and satins, all immaculate on stage, small and crude. A good actor is good and can move by his art under any conditions. They are wonders. Such songs and monologues, dances. First enjoyable moment since I am in army. A symphony orchestra of 25 Men. In middle of second act, gallery caves in. Our boys are on it. Wood supports and beams give way. A great crash, much dust but show goes on. Everybody tumbles in a heap on straw underneath. Nobody hurt except a Tommy who has nose scratched. I stand on a piece of wreckage giving up my dixie for Gillece to stand on and we enjoy show. Would have kicked myself had I not come. Back after performance with water. Cold. Would like a cup of tea. Some embers still in grate. Fill mess cups with water, boil, make tea. Divide with cooks who reward us with a piece of bread with jam. Clear. Go to bed at 10. Sleep well. No noise of battle to disturb me. It is much warmer. My new shoes are as wet as though I had filled them with water. An Englishman has been hovering about our camp for a long time. I am trying to find out why.

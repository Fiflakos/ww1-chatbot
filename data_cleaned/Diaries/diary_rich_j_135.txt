Author: Thomas James Richards. Date: 22nd November 1916. Nationality: Australian. November 22nd. Wednesday.It was a heavy misty morning but at midday asmothered sun appeared. At 2 o'clock I mounted "JohnGilpin", Ned Reynolds on "Old Tom" and off we went toHeilly, a decent village 6 kilos away. There the sunshone strongly and I enjoyed the exhilaration of ridingover the springy turf fields, moreso as "John" is a goodtrotter and can jump cleanly over gutters and holes.At night I waited with three other chaps in adouble line for the second house at the picture show butthe place was full before our turn to enter came so we hada pint of cold beer and some biscuits, and with cold feetwandered back to the canvas home between the shafts of"Windy's" cart. It was necessary to light the fire, soto get wood a post was removed from the road side and itwarmed us up some.At present I have a lovely camp stretcher to sleepon and about six blankets, yet I cover up my head each nightand find my feet cold very often. What I will do when in theline with one or no blankets at all, is causing me a littleworry even now.

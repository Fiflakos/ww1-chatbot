Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Jul. 14, 1918 Weather: Fair, warm Health: Fair Up at 8:00. Have breakfast. Rice, bacon, bread, coffee. There is some shelling, also aeroplanes up, which are attracting shell fire. I lie down on my bunk. Am not feeling extra well. Fall asleep for an hour. Wash at the brook. An aeroplane is up somewhere. I am anxious to see what is on the other side of the railroad track. Make an attempt to investigate. Before I am well started an ominous swish is heard. Sounds near enough to scare us. Seems it will drop close to us. Lands somewhere in the vicinity where he played for on Friday. A machine gun close at hand. No place for me. I get my towel and go upstairs. He continues shelling. From our window, we can see what they sit and where they land. High explosive, large calibre shells. Our artillery essays to return MG fire. Five or six shells to Fritz's one for a few minutes. This calls for a punishing fire from Fritz. He literally rains shells upon the road between ........ and ........ The damage he is doing must be considerable. He silences our batteries entirely. I do not think he puts them out of action, but it is evidently useless to reply. Our boys grow hilarious in their joy at the spectacle. Mark 41! Good work! Keep it up!, etc. I go downstairs to sit at the table under the tree, where I wish to write. In a short time, I am interrupted by three men who have just come in from an all night ambush patrol. The shelling has not ceased. They sing over our head constantly. Renny, one of three men, is making a show of bravado, chaffing his companions about being white livered. He has issued a challenge to Fritz to come over from the center of a shell hole. He thinks because his companions have not done that, they lack courage. I must go away. It disgusts me to listen to him. Go upstairs again, where it is so noisy, that I cannot write. So I take another 220nap. Sleep until twelve. Dinner. Beans, bread, coffee. That is bad for my stomach. Lie down again. Fall asleep. Awake at 2. Begin writing. My mind will not work well. I begin to think a little exercise will do me good. I would like to go for a walk. Sgt. Stewart comes in with a solution to the problem. He has a message to be delivered to Capt. Frothingham. It has been my intention to see him in regard to passing Lt. Griffith's note on to the Capt., who relieves him when his own company goes back to rest tonight. I volunteer to go. I find the Captain, give him the message, receiving an answer. Then tell him who I am and that I have been sick. He tells me that I was almost to be turned in to the MR as a deserter. I express surprise. Must report at 7 oclock to be turned over to the company relieving. Go with him to locate a Very pistol add two white flares. They cannot be found. No one knows where they can be procured. I get a pistol, but no lights. Take back with me two flares of some kind, which no one knows anything about. Report back to Lt. Godfrey. He does not know what to do with the flares. I write a letter to Leah until supper time. A lean supper. Potato pancakes, bread, coffee. Write until 7 o'clock, when I report to Sgt. Lt. Godfrey calls his men together to instruct them in what he intended to do to-night. I meet Wager later and ask him most sincerely not to some back, telling that another man has been wounded or killed. At 7, I meet Sgt. Pittman. He is one of those close order fiends. We must march in formation and all that sort of rot. My anger at the practice blows away in an instant when I see that he has mail for me. Officially turned over. Our mail is handed out to us. I get the fright of my life when I see under the first envelope, two with a mourning border. I feel faint - relieved to find they go to Lenehan. He always get his letters on such stationary. 5 from Leah, one each from Becks, Dolly, Lottie. No chance to read them. I must go to work. Loading and unloading a trench. It begins to rain. As I have no raincoat, the other fellows do all the work. I go back as soon as it stops raining, I must do gas guard from 12 to 3. I offer to do so gladly. Men have gone out on patrol. Read my letters. All good news. Leahs anniversary letter to me. Baby's picture has been taken and is on the way. Read each letter twice. Write more to Leah, suggested by her letters. Raining intermittently as I write alone. Other men who have not gone on patrol are asleep. I intend to remain awake. No use going to bed, as long as I have a letter to write. At 11:15, Bennett, one of the men who had gone out on patrol, comes into quarters looking like a ghost, panting for breath, wringing wet from sweat, with an order from the Lt. that every man in the place dress, fully equipped, and meet him outside, in the street. Men are awakened and dress, everybody excited, not knowing what to make of the order. It is quiet outside but for a few shells from our guns going to Fritz. I put away my writing, get on my things, and when I am all dressed, Milne comes in looking just the same as Bennett, when he came in. Something mysterious is in the wind. Mere men come in, look frightened to death. One of the men, R..., whispers to me, "Dick (Sgt. Stewart) has been shot". I am shocked, sorry beyond words. He was such a nice fellow, I admired him so, in the morning in the full bloom of health. The order now is to stay indoors. We talk in whispers and discuss the tragic affair. It seems he is wounded in the face. Renny, the man who displayed so much bravado in the morning is the culprit. He mistook Stewart for a Boche the men say. I cannot believe it. I am disgusted. Lie down in the dark. The candles have been put out and windows opened. I hear a scuffling in the next room. Whispering, excitedly, we rush in. They have brought in Renny, the man who did the shooting. He is delirious. "Dick, Dick, Dick. I didn't mean to do it" he is saying, crying, struggling to be 221freed. He wants to kill himself. Boys whisper that Dick is alright. Soothe him. Plead with him to be calm. Poor fellow. This morning so brave and now! Other members of the patrol straggle in. All the worse for their experiences. Wager has sprained his ankle. Lt. assures men not to worry. Stewart is being attended to. No one knows where he is, it develops. I go on guard. Men are being sent for a doctor. I am sent to Capt., then told to stay. Relief coming in. Halt a man a minute. No one gives the password correctly. Stewart is brought to the door on a stretcher by four men who have carried him over No Mans Land. He is a brave lad. Breathes with difficulty. His lung has been penetrated by the bullet. He is taken to the dressing station after a great deal of fuss and red tape. Afterwards, different versions of the affair come in. Street is quiet after 1. A few shells and a little fray in the area to left. Go to bed at 3. Boys remain awake long. Their nerves are shattered. One man stays awake to guard Renny. He falls asleep at 2.

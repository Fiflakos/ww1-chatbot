Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 12 June 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Wed. Jun. 12, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Hike 19 Kilometres to ......... Awakened at 2. We have reached destination. Ordered to put on packs, turn in rations and get out on a station platform. All the men who were drunk are able to move but Lenehan. He cannot be stirred and is in great pain. Allowed to lie in car until company moves off, when he is packed into an ambulance along with a few others. Formed in platoon to take roll call. Take off packs and wait until wagons and ration is unloaded. I am sleepy and grouchy. It is cold. Must walk up and down to keep warm. When fire is started I stand near cookers. Growing light rapidly. Men scramble for water. Many parched throats. Told how to deport ourselves among soldiers in sector. To the best of our knowledge a six mile hike is before us, tired and hungry though we are. We lead column and hit up a brisk pace through village. A large factory, shops and named streets. ........., a sizable town. Women and men up with the light of day, look at us from windows as we go by. It is uphill, beautiful country, hills and plateaus, along brooks and through forests. I have nothing to say. Will not listen to chatter of men. Wish only that Leah were with me to enjoy a leisurely tour through this part of France. March a half hour and halt. Some men break through, come to brookside and refresh themselves with a wash. Others sit down to rest. A good many fall asleep in a few seconds. Up again and march for a full fifty minute period into .......... Another march to a wood outside of .........., where we halt. Cookers and water carts come up. Off goes pack. Captain tells us we breakfast at 7 and rest till 1, when we move in. Most of us fall asleep. I feel somewhat fresher and remain awake. Breakfast. Coffee and a piece of hard task. Complaints, Some men do not even get that. They have slept and did not wake till late. Not enough ration to last till end of line. Captain disturbed and takes personal interest in arrangements for dinner. Has platoon Sgts. announce that we will have a good dinner at 11:30. Wants us all to rest till then. Roads and towns out of bounds. Does not deter men from stealing out through woods to village for eggs and a swim. Most go to sleep on their slickers. I go into woods, where I will not be disturbed and write. In ten minutes I fall asleep, pen in hand. Nap for half an hour, then go back to camp. Lie down on Maloys slicker, but cannot sleep. Toss about till 11. Get up to see how dinner is getting on. Water carts are empty, so nothing has been done except to empty canned stew into dixies. Officers are becoming anxious lest we cannot leave at 1. I am sent to look for water. Find strawberries instead. Water cart comes back. Stew is ready in 15 minutes. Write rather than wait on line. Dinner. Stew and coffee. Boys want to know where promised good dinner is. Make up packs, leaving blouses off. It is very hot. Off at one promptly. Supply company mourns one horse, which died and has been buried in the woods. They have trouble starting account of flies bothering horses. We wait five minutes for them to come up. Off again for a full hour's hike, without rest, along an excellent road, but mostly uphill. Hay is being cut in every field. We pass by one close to the road from which the breeze blows to us an odor sweeter than any perfume. Women, children, old men, soldiers home on leave, all at work raking it into wagons made of what looks like two ladders, one on each side. Rest for 15 minutes and at the end of the next march come upon a village where some of our men are quartered. Questions about Jim and John and a hearty welcome. A pump in the square where we halt is immediately besieged by thirsty men with bottles. A fight to get water, which lasts till time to fall in. Boys still fight for water ignoring call from officers to assemble. Those who disobey will be punished. Push on for 50 minutes past another village, where there is a stream which makes men shout with delight. But we do not stop here. So they grow entirely mutinous and shout to be allowed to fall out. No heed paid to them by Major or Capt. until time is up. Fall out in a wood, told we have only 25 minutes more walking to do, which proves correct almost to the minute. Pitch tests in a cut hayfield at the entrance to the village. Some discussion as to how tents are to be lined. I take a half hour's nap in the meantime. Do not have to move. Shave. Write. Fill canteen which has been empty all day. Supper. Rice, figs, tea. Short rations. None have come up from quartermaster. A scramble for eggs, all over town, bread and milk which are source. Wine is cheap, so plenty is bought. Walk through village to a brook to bathe my feet. It is as cold as ice. A wonderful tonic. Come back to tent and write till dark. Then light candle and continue until 10:30. Go to bed. Sleep well. In all the villages we passed on way up from RR station, water is very plentiful. A brook or two flows through each. There are troughs in the squares into which water flows in a constant stream from a spigot. Every house has a miniature shrine over the door, shrines by the wayside. Dwellings mostly two story affairs of white sandstone. Not very well taken care of. Very old. One built in 1720. Few men about. Quite a number of children and old women. Washing is done on flat, brown sandstones mounted on troughs. We make use of them at once. Cherries, plums, strawberries plentiful. Mountains in the distance. Wood plentiful. Lenehan has been with us on afternoon hike. Begging for water every minute. His stomach must be in very bad condition. He has emptied canteen of every man near him on march. Lt. forbids him to drink anymore, but he is desperate and disobeys. A pitiful sight to behold. Long hair disheveled and face drawn from sufferings. Every hike finds someone in trouble for a similar cause. I have had very little water during day. Cannot tell how distant we are from front. Only a few distant rumblings of cannon heard. One aeroplanes hum. Charmed beyond description with surroundings. Thu. Jun. 13, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Captain tells some very good tidings. The day will be given up more or less to rest. A formation at 9 oclock, another for Retreat at five PM. Free to go wherever we please within a reasonable distance from camp, excepting in 1st Battalion area. Breakfast. Fried evaporated potatoes, tea. I am one of the very few satisfied. Eggs are in great demand. Sardines, peas and whatever canned stuff can be bought is procured at very high prices. I do some washing. When I come bank I find we have been ordered to prepare for inspection of all equipment at 10:30. Get to work immediately. Show everything that I have. Clean my very rusty gun. Tents must be taken down, halves folded up. Report is that Fritz is up taking aeroplane pictures. Same procedure to be followed every day. A nuisance. Trucks done up with our small blanket rolls. Most of them are broken up. Many can not be found. I spend more than an hour hunting for mine. Look for it in every company pile in vain. I am worried over loss for Leah's letters are in it. I value these more than remainder of contents. Trucks have come directly into field and wheels have sunk into soft earth. A difficult task to pull one of them out. Two trucks are needed for tow. From time to time, I make an examination of rolls remaining unclaimed but mine does not turn up. Report same but nothing can be done. Hang around entire morning waiting for inspection of my equipment. Decide to go into woods behind tent to write until noon mess, keeping a watchful eye peeled for officers if they should happen to reach my tent. They abandon idea of inspection, asking men to report shortage of equipment to Supply Sgt. Mess. Evaporated vegetables and bully beef stew, tea. Enough stew to go the rounds twice. Captain takes measures to hurry delivery of rations. Situation becoming serious. Nothing left in kitchen. Reserve all used up. Bread greatly missed. Chickens in danger of their lives. I see two which have already sacrificed their lives to help win the war. One woman in the town has cornered the egg market, a thing little expected in this sleepy village. She gets 5 Frs. per dozen for them. Traveling notion carts come into the square and do a thriving business. Men need ink, soap, pipes, combs, paper, etc. Charge a franc or more for the smallest articles and 1 Fr. for a bottle of ink which I buy. Later in day prices recede. I look for a quiet spot to write. Follow brook which runs through village into the woods. Men are bathing naked. Women in fields look on or pass by making comment, unabashed. I find a spot in woods to suit my purpose. A moss covered stump for a writing desk. Comfortable while I smoke. Run out of matches. Cannot light pipe. Horse flies and large mosquitos drive me away. Walk to camp along edge of woods to look for strawberries. Find a few. Loaf for a few minutes. Begin writing a letter to Leah. Seriously worried about scarcity of mail. What I write cannot be posted either, but it will be in readiness as soon as arrangements for mailing can be made. Supper. Bully beef, mashed potatoes, rhubarb, tea. An excellent meal. I was under the impression that Captain purchases potatoes and rhubarb with money from mess funds, but hear later that Del Duca was the donor of it. Captain has word that rations are due to arrive before six in the morning. Pitch tent, make bed, thankful for extra blanket from Rubin's roll. Continue writing. Lieut. Cook and men are having a great deal of fun tossing men in a blanket. I await my doom, expecting to be called upon every minute for Lt. says purpose of game is to liven up the "dead ones". I am sure men would have been delighted to give me a ride but Lt. Cook respects me as an old man and a papa writing to his loved ones. Large and small lured into the circle, surrounded and tossed until men are tired. Rank not considered. Non-coms get as much attention as privates when supply of "grease balls" runs out. Rubin caught. Tossed twice. Blanket splits. Another taken. Kept up until long after dark. Men asleep in their tents taken out for the purpose of shaking up their supper. Men from other companies caught. Everybodys grudges satisfied. Next tent to ours, boys are gathered around singing endless song, which is extremely clever though smutty. Mason and another drunk, proclaiming he does not care for the crowned heads of Europe but is a great friend of Presidents. I finish writing as darkness comes. Go to bed. Lie awake talking to Rubin until 11 o'clock. Discuss merits and virtues, accomplishments of our wives at home. Is it well to have a baby at home or not? I have, Thank God, and I am happy that Leah has someone to love and fuss over in my absence. Someone to inspire her and give her courage. I live over again all the events of our courtship and marriage, say my prayers and fall asleep. Awakened at three by rattle of ration wagons coming in. This is an ideal summer camp. Not a suggestion of war all day. Everybody has scoured neighboring country for cigarettes and chocolate. Not a canteen found. Our usual luck. Two men from company have an arrangement with a lorry driver to bring supplies from .........., 12 kms. distant. Officers give their consent. No sign of my blanket roll.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 22 April 1918. Location: FRANCE. Nationality: Australian. Text: Monday April 22, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Fair, Only slight headache Up at 6:00. Wash, make bunk. Out for a few minutes to look about. Go to parapet fortifications. Want to go on sick call to prepare against possible headache. Cannot find doctor. Issued three tickets, one each for breakfast, dinner, tea. Breakfast. Canned sausage, bread, butter, jam, coffee. Lots of it and good. Run up to canteen to get cigarettes. Out of tobacco. Supply in pack. Company formed. We move down road to tents camp. Twelve men in small circular tent. Puzzled to find how we will sleep. Go back for blankets which with packs fill up tent. Watch English drill. We do not fraternize at all. There are coolies, Indians. Most motley aggregation of men I ever saw what with our own men of every nationality. Many women workers. Children drawing carts. Company formed with rifles and marched through village to ordnance warehouse, to get new style rifle and bayonet. Road full of children begging. Women and little girls selling fruit and chocolate. Houses ramshackle, plaster and mud walls, dirty and ill kept. No men in sight. A long wait for our turn. One man taken ill. Road alive with traffic. Supply trucks, messengers, gendarmes. See a steam propelled vehicle which looks to be very efficient. Ambulances from station bringing in wounded going to "Blighty". Some pitiful cases. Others slightly wounded fill up big trucks. They are a happy crowd. Faces and arms and legs bandaged. Severely wounded driven very slowly. Women chauffeurs. Bicycles by the score. All officials ride. Most women in mourning. Get a new rifle and bayonet, late model. Clean pieces in street. Dust blows and covers where we take off grease. Check up and go back for dinner. Mutton stew, bread, rice pudding. Company forms again and marched off for miles along a stream to gas mask station. Given a mask and instructed in its use. While we wait I start a letter to Leah. Women and children reap a harvest selling chocolate at exorbitant prices to men. Officers cannot drive them away. Very late. Go to ordnance stores to draw ammunitions and steel helmets. Much fun trying on helmets. A long march back to camp. Boys amuse themselves by coaxing coolies to march in column with us. Give them helmets to wear. An audience of English all along route. Back in camp at 8. Supper of cheese, bread, jam of which we partake ravenously. I am very hungry. We make some sort of order in our tent in the rapidly falling light. Put packs along the walls to use as pillows and stretch blankets toward center pole. Thus we make arrangements for ten men to sleep. Two men find space in an empty tent in camp. I go to bed immediately. Some men have gone to town and at 9 they return and upset everything in the darkness. It rains for a few minutes. Tent is waterproof however. During our march of about 10 miles only camps and stores were seen. Everything gives up to the military establishment. One thing that impresses me is the salvage dumps where worn out and discarded material and equipment are stored and reclaimed, if possible. Another thing is the good order and cleanliness prevailing about English barracks. Where an Englishman stays he builds himself a garden in his spare time. English officers I see all carry canes and are dressed to perfection. I see a windmill and cottages built of mud and straw. The French permit their trees to grow to the height of the first branches and clip them off, leaving knobs only, probably using twigs and branches for firewood and preserving the trunks of the trees. We pass down avenues lined with these trees on both sides. From the distance they look like huge knobbed walking sticks. Estaminets or cafes in every village in the proportion of about ten to every fifteen houses. Crowded with Englishmen drinking beer and red wine.

Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 4 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Sun. Aug. 4, 1918 Weather: Showers, Warm Health: Good Hike 8 kilometres to ........ Wake up at 11. Dress without my drawers, which I will wash and trust to luck that they will dry enough to wear by the time we leave. Go for dinner. Steak, potatoes, onions, bread, Karo, coffee. The leanest woman I ever saw hangs around the kitchen with two children. The kiddies are given hard tack and bread and the woman gets a pot of coffee, some meat 259and a can of grease, not quite empty. She is tickled beyond description. Sends one of the youngsters down with things as fast as she gets them, with orders to come back at once. They each make many trips. Other street urchins get bread and what the men leave, being specially pleased with the Karo. About a mile of street in the town, with houses on both sides, a pretentious church, a smaller shrine in the center of the village, a butcher and baker, and a few other stores. Plenty of water and fruit. Plums, nuts, apples and pears. Make a discovery in the shape of a large, seedless, yellow apple, which is only fruit ripe enough to eat. Even they are still tart. See Del Duca on the street with a hat full of eggs. We tease him. He makes as if to throw an egg at us. I dare him to. He closes in on me and I go towards him ready to catch it, thinking he means to be friendly and throw it so that I can get it. It proves otherwise though. He throws the egg with force, intent upon having it splash on my clothes. I turn around, trying to avoid it and it breaks on my back and splashes all over my shirt, so I am out of luck again. I must got a knife and scrape it and hang the shirt to dry. Disregarding orders, I go to the pump to wash with only breeches and undershirt on. I wash my drawers, too. My bottom shows through two great big holes in my pants. Any place but in France I would have been ashamed. There are many women and some pretty girls, who do not mind me in the least. They are neater than the average village girl I have seen. This is a clean town on the whole. Of course there is lots of manure in piles in front of the houses, but the street is clean. Hang my things to dry and look for fruit again. I am still stiff and sore from the night's hike and a trifle sleepy, so I lie down for a nap until 3:30. I am awakened by Himpler, who wants to get his things together to roll his pack. Himpler has orders to go to ........ on the billeting detail. When he tells me what our probable destination is, I am surprised that the hike is so short. Get out the map and try to dope out where we will entrain and what our probable destination is. It appears to me, logically, we go to ........ . An old woman is interested in the map reading. Supper is ready. Beans and beef stew, Karo, bread, coffee. When half finished with supper, it begins to rain. I hurriedly finish my supper, while two Frenchwomen who have evidently seen my wedding ring discuss me. I listen without letting on that I understand. I smile to myself and think of their surprise if they saw the bottom of my pants. I remember that my drawers are spread on a wood pile to dry and hurry like the devil down street to my billet. Halfway there I am so wet and likewise my drawers, that it is useless to go further. Take shelter until the shower is over. Get my drawers and wring the water from them. Possibly they will dry in the two hours that are left before we move. The sun is hot. Wash my feet. A job that I have saved for the last minute. Roll my pack, ready to put on my hump. A bit of time left for writing. I sit on a box. My hand is unsteady. Go upstairs to write on window sill. That does not work well, either. Downstairs again. After ten minutes, I want to give it up as a bad job. Put up my pen. Change my mind. Rather than be idle, I will try again. It works fairly well after my resolution is made and up to the time I am ordered to fall in, I almost finish the page. My drawers are not dry, so it is necessary to go without them. Roll them wet into my slicker, which goes over the pack. Fall in outside. There is a rainbow again, not near as fine as Friday's. Farrell and Ernst show up, ready to march with us. They are looked upon with anger by the sergeants. Black and his gang come up at the last minute. They have been licking up beer and are feeling fine. All present, we are the first ones off. March down the street amid the cheers of the other men. We give one cheer for those whom we do not 260like. Capt. McMurtry passes. We have the satisfaction of making him smile. Black is singing a new song, composed in the estaminet, a parody on "If he can love". It draws applause. Uphill over the bridge to the point where the head of the column should be. We are on the crest again, looking down on wheat and rye, uncut, potatoes and truck. Stacks of cut grain, orchard and streams to the foot of the hill at our left. Fall out to wait, while Black gives his cabaret in the hearing of G Co. Much applause. Farrell and Maloy are mellow and begin cheering everybody, both styles, until they are hoarse. Maloy grows familiar with the adjutant. We are all feeling good, because the hike is so short. The destination of the army for the night is known to everybody now. A good level road, or down hill. Cheering individuals now. G Co. sings songs. Greenwald is cheered with a hurrah, and a verse of the song is composed for him, which went "if he can hike like he can write". Of course the diary is mentioned. We hike steadily without a stop and go through the town of ........ in the dusk. The dung piles are small, denoting poverty, according to the boys. It is a full hour before we are permitted to fall out. The 3rd Battalion is in the town. They are out to watch us go by. We deride them, calling them grease balls and they return the compliment. The singing and cheering have helped wonderfully to keep the men in lines. For my part, I would just as soon have gone on to the end of the trip to ......... , the church spires of which can just be seen in the fast failing light. It is a fine night, the stars promise to come out in their brightest dress. It is cool. The grass upon which we lie is wet, too wet for me to sit on. I am bare below, so I lie on my side. In fifteen minutes we are under way again. Down hill, to the foot of the hill upon which the town is built. It is a hard climb up, but we get up without much discomfort because we are so fresh. It smells like hell of barns and dung. We are billeted quickly. The scouts are split up this time in different billets. Five of us in a barn with a floor full of holes. There is plenty of good straw. Through the floor, when the candles are lit, can be seen cows and pigs, The officers' horses are put in the stalls below, too. They snort and stomp below, which makes it all the more uncertain that I get a good night's sleep. It smells too much for me to understand why the other fellows think it a good place to sleep. I sleep alone tonight. Would like to take my breeches off but my drawers are still wet. The companies are being made to wait a long time before they are billeted. There is noise in the streets up till the time I go to sleep. Go to bed at once and sleep for two hours, when the noise of the animals wakes me. There is a dog in the loft with us, which barks in the night and wakes me again. All day not the sound of a gun, rifle or aeroplane. An ideal quiet Sunday. I find my French improving somewhat. I can understand fairly well if it is spoken slowly. With what little I can talk and gesture, I can now make myself understood. We travel with an interpreter in this march. He and the YMCA man are attached to this battalion. They are traveling without packs, yet they have blistered feet and stiff limbs. That kind of makes the men feel proud that they are no worse though they carry a heavy pack. Hamilton very sick, apparently from eating green apples. He vomits and has diarrhea. The infirmary busy fixing up sore feet.

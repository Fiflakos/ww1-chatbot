Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 14 April 1918. Location: At Sea. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sunday. April 14, 1918 Weather: fair, warm, sea calm Health: cold no better At Sea Boys of our Company detailed to study launching of lifeboats and assisting in everything. Up at 6:00. On deck for Reveille. Downstairs to wash. Boys see a porpoise. Upstairs for muster and a look around. Fleet riding together with cruiser well in lead. A promise of a beautiful day, which I cannot enjoy to full extent because I am in great distress because nose and head full of cold. I use handkerchief constantly. Breakfast. Oatmeal, liver and bacon, bread, butter, and coffee. Make bunk, police and go upstairs to read until boat drill, at which we assemble quickly. Dismissed. Crew men are kept on deck. Get rifles and are drilled in manual by non-coms. Everybody works unwillingly. Signal men taken in hand by Lt. Cook. I am not in class. Watch drilling for a while and find a spot on boat deck to sun myself and read. I try to write a letter to Leah telling her of last nights events, but I cannot concentrate. Attention distracted by drilling. Frequent coughing spells. Crew has a fire drill. All mess boys come on deck and to their stations carrying a blanket. Many gongs ring and whistles blow in different parts of the ship. A little excitement before reason is learned. Think it is some kind of submarine danger alarm. Boys on deck are sprayed by hose. Read till time for mess. Soup, bad meat, potatoes, plum duff. One of crew has scarlet fever. Notice posted to that effect and soldiers are warned not to mingle with men of the forecastle. On deck until 2:30 when we are sent below to await call for drill. Get upstairs in good time. Everybody present. Dismissed. New men and signalmen are put to work as in forenoon. I clamber into a collapsible boat looking for a place to write. Find a comfortable spot but cannot write. Disturbed by others. A guard is in boat to prevent men from loafing in boats 1A and 1, which are already slung on davits. Fear tackle may be tampered with. I try to lie down and take a nap. No place big enough to fit me. Gasp for air when I lie down. Spend a very restless hour. Am finally forced to get out and go below for a walk. Every ship in fleet in manoeuvering and zig-zagging according to plan (I presume). Lt. Cook has been to our quarters and found a number of dirty guns. Orders everyone to give attention to rifles. I spend an hour taking off rust which is plentiful. Take a half hours nap before supper. I am very hungry and very much disappointed. Head cheese, bread, jam, and stewed apples, tea. Eat a lot of rice and apples but it does not take the edge off my hunger. Take a laxative pill thinking it will help my cold a little. Walk around the deck until darkness falls. All lights are out. Spend a few minutes wondering at a salami one of the boys has brought in his pocket from New York and which is now being greedily devoured. Go below and get to bed as quickly as possible. I am not sleepy so I reread parts of a magazine I have been going through all day. Lieutenant of H. Company comes into hatch and asks all Catholics to assemble in prayer. Has an enlisted man, evidently a bible student, as his reader. Card games are stopped for the time being and about fifty boys gather around while the Rosary is told. They kneel of life belts and repeat prayer after reader. It sounds similar to the chanting which I heard, while in quarantine at Camp Upton, coming from the Mess Hall. I find myself repeating parts of the prayer because I listen intently to the reader. Service soon over. Fall asleep. Wake up 2 or 3 times during night to find myself dreaming.

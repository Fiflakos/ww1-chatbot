Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 11 May 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Sat. May 11, 1918 Weather: Fair, Mild Health: Good Up at 5:00. Breakfast. Bacon, bread, coffee. Company goes out for a day afield. Field kitchen, water carts, all equipment goes along. Rifle practice most of day. British praise our marksmanship. I have an hour and a half to myself. Wash, shave, get out a pair of new leggings from the bottom of the barrack bag. All dressed up. Go to Hdqrs. to finish work on payroll. Major and officers already out on field with men. The office is quiet giving every one an opportunity to put in a lot of work. Finish last company payroll and go over addition of columns to check. Find one error. Convert amounts to francs. At eleven o'clock I go up to Divisional Hdqrs. to find out whether money can be drawn today or tomorrow as we move within 48 hours. Area billeting officer has been in and given us tip that orders will soon come through. Lt. Graham anxious to pay men off before we march. Acting on advance information, Sgt. Major begins packing. At Disbursement Office, but disappointment awaits us. He will not pay on rolls as made out. Insufficient data and non- compliance to forms prevent him from paying. He will look over sheets personally this afternoon and do his best to put them through. Too bad he had not paid sufficient attention to payrolls day we reported for instructions. I come back with Fox who accompanied us. Grow eloquent in a tirade against the cruelty of the bayonet as an instrument of modern warfare. Get my mess first, then report. Rations have been left behind for me in quarters. Two big bully beef sandwiches, plenty of bread and jam and coffee., I look with pity at cook, who has built a fine supplementary oven out of sheet-iron and mud all for no purpose. Company clerk has news of movement too. Go back to Batt. Hdqrs. with letter from Cpl. Height, marked Govt. Business, probably extra endowment blanks for Cecilie, which I have made out while eating. Leave a horseshoe which I found on way back from Div. Hdqrs. outside gate while I deliver letter. Go back to billets forgetting to take it with me. Return for it. Leave word to be called if wanted and where I can be found. My days work is finished. I start on my own work by writing. Then I do my week's wash in field. Cows look on and almost speak. They look at me and inquire if I will dirty their drinking water. I assure them I will not. They test my veracity and go away. Finish in an hour. Spread clothes to dry on grass behind our barn. Surprised to find that machine gun squad is back before rest of company. They have evaded drill. Leonard and I ask Madam if she has any milk. She has and in addition she brings us each a piece of bread and butter and some cold boiled potatoes. I do not wish to take her offering but as Leonard avails himself of her generosity, so do I. We each have two glasses of milk besides. I remain to chat with Madam. Tell her about the Draft Army and conditions in America. She tells me of France. We understand each other quite well. Begin writing a letter to Leah. Interrupted to look at airplanes high up, which appear to be Germans. Continue lying on grass, sun shining, until time for mess. Cheese, bread, coffee. My writing has not pleased me this afternoon. My thoughts are not fluent. Decide to try it again, but give it up as a bad job, deciding to do better tomorrow. Boys have all been tipped off of movement to different quarters. Buzzing, false rumors. Official orders posted on barn door. List of articles to be put in pack is read first. It is a mule's job. 100 extra rounds of ammunition, extra pair of shoes, OD shirt, slicker to be carried in addition to what we had in pack when we came. Barrack bags to be left behind. Up at 6:45, bags turned in, inspection of packs, retreat & reveille formations announced for tomorrow. No Sunday rest if complied with. A hurried catalog is taken of stuff necessary and unnecessary, which will be either discarded or taken against orders. some men already packing bags. All make small pack, used all week for drill purposes making extra blanket available. I take a trip to the village to buy matches. Return to read paper. Get a bar of chocolate from one of the boys. Waiting for Reilly to come back from the Canteen with probably some cake. He is back at nine with cake. I am very hungry. Remember I have a can of bully bee from rations received on last trip, which I have been saving for emergency, but as we will receive new rations when we leave, probably tomorrow, it is no longer necessary to guard. We have cake and bully beef as a bedtime repast. All turn in, much reserved in our thoughts with little discussion about tomorrow. We have an idea we go to ......... front, where our men have been to observe. No sound of activity whatever at any time during the day, which in a manner considering recent inactivity also confirms rumor of a five day armistice, which has been gaining credence among men. In the air only a few scout planes up, incident in afternoon excepted.

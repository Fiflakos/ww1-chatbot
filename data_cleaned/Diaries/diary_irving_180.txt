Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 15 August 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Thurs. Aug. 15, 1918 Weather: Fine, Warm Health: Fair, Very Tired Gassed I sit on the floor with the rest of them. Sometimes with my mask off, sometimes on. I try to sleep in it. It grows light. Ordered out of the dugout so that a fire can be built to burn up the gas, and that the gas and flies can be fanned out. Little Jake Allen cannot stand on his feet, nor can Bowring. Others fighting with themselves to bear up. Stretchers are procured 284and Allen and Bowring taken to first aid. Other men taken down the street in the lull that prevails. Driven downstairs again by shells falling into the village. Mask off for a while. The dugout quickly fills with gas. Hessler working hard to clear it, all the time with his mask off. When we take ours off we leave the mouth and nose pieces adjusted. The air is occasionally pure depending on the wind, but gas and the smell of dead men across the street prevails. Not a wink of sleep yet. Report of casualties soon in. G Co. suffered heavily from gas and shells, 2 men dead and buried. E Co. stayed in the woods. The men who came down with me sent back with another guide, H. Co. all gassed. C Co. men gassed and wounded by shells. A costly relief. All the scouts and Headquarters from the Major down are gassed. They will feel the full effect of it to-morrow and to-night. Our guns are busy now. Getting the best of the deal. Men trying to sleep on the dugout floor. No room for me. I want to sleep too. The only way is to go back to Rgtl. Hdqrs. Jorgensen and Kennedy are going to F Co., in the woods where I left them last night. It is on my way back and they do not know the road, so I volunteer to show them the way. We go out quickly, run up the hill past the dead. Rest in funk hole before I go out in the open. The men complain of the danger and the pace I set. We are not fired upon by shells, but I can hear the bullets of snipers whisk past. By the roadside 6 men carrying stretcher with big Krause in it. His leg torn by a shell fragment. Seriously wounded, a brave lad. Meet Coyle in the woods going to the infirmary. With him is Greenstein, badly shell shocked. O'Keefe gassed and Coyle himself in bad shape from gas. Coyle tells me Longinotti's arm has been blown off, Schein hurt, Russey gassed and a dozen others with minor injuries. Rest for a time in the woods. Attacked with cramps. Through the woods and into the cluster of big guns behind it. Down the hill to the farmhouse. The slope is pitted with holes made after I left yesterday afternoon. Get further reports of casualties. Hdqrs. has established a kitchen here too. I beg for some bread and jam while thinking that E kitchen has moved out. My wits are dull. Get a cup of hot coffee too. Lie down on another man's bunk with his towel over my face to protect me against the flies in the big barn. I sleep a few hours. Move to another barn later. An air battle directly over us. We seek shelter. The Hun is driven off by ack G and superior force, but he knows the location of our kitchens. Sleep fitfully in a daze, my body twitching nervously, until mess time. Wounded men taken away in ambulance. Dinner. Steak, cabbage, bread pudding, coffee. Do things automatically. See Doherty, who takes me back with Lt. Woods to ........ where Rgtl. Hdqrs. are. I find my pack. Lie down in a stinking barn with a hot slicker over my head to guard against flies. Badly stiffened, sore, dopey. Awakened by Doherty to take a message. I refuse to go back to Batt. Hdqrs. A long argument with him. I do not reason or I would not have refused to go; it seems like a form of hysteria comes over me now. I protest that McLeary should go. Doherty heeds my suggestion. Fritz begins shelling the town now. Get supper in the detachment kitchen around the corner. Some of our big guns are firing. They are quite near. The house in which supper is being served rocks as though it were coming down around our ears at any moment. Supper. Potatoes, canned roast beef, bread and coffee. Learn that a new liaison system has been established. Messages will be relayed by 4 posts to Batt. Hdqrs. Now only necessary for me to take messages to Post 1, where Mac will be stationed, near the Red Cross ambulances on the road outside the town. Pleased at the prospect of not having to pass dead men. Arrange for bunk space in 285room next to the street. A message comes which must go to the farmhouse instead of Post 1. The Sgt. wishes to make sure they are relayed from there. Full of fear about going up. Shelling all around us, mostly behind Rgtl. Hdqrs., where our big guns are. Fritz is on to their position. The shell fragments rain down upon us. Some fall in front or us and across the street. The Colonel outside without even a helmet for protection. My message is probably only a dummy. I am well on my way when I am recalled to get and deliver a real message and important papers. Some close calls from flying steel. Hurry as fast as I can to the farm. It is growing dark, the time Fritz picks for doing his worst and again I want to get back to sleep if I can. All in when I reach the farm. Arrangements for relay are there. Messages are forwarded from there. On my way back. Shelling ahead of me. Get into town as a Boche plane appears overhead. Find shelter in YMCA, where I buy tobacco, matches and gum. Cannot leave for some time. MPs order everyone inside while the Boche is being shelled. I am anxious to get to quarters, so I disobey orders and skirting the walls of the battered houses, I wend my way towards home amid a rain of steel. Halt every time I hear a missile whistling towards earth. When the shell breaks, I hug the earth, listening to the shell fragments striking upon the housetops or landing in the road. As I arrive near my quarters, a bursting shell sends a shower of death close to the men standing in the doorway. Doherty comes within an inch of being hit. A piece weighing more than two pounds falls directly in front of our threshold. I remain indoors from then on. Lie down on the hard floor and endeavor, by smoking and relaxation, to quiet my nerves. That is impossible. The building itself is as nervous as I. Our own guns and Fritz's shelling rock the rickety structure during my hour. The door and the window frames rattle. Sgt. Murray has another message to go out at 9:30, after I have removed my leggings for comfort. Doherty offers to take it up. I marvel at his sudden display of energy and consideration. Before he can start, it is announced we are relieved from duty by Lt. Kidde and ordered to report back to Batt. Hdqrs. at ........, where are the dead men. I do not propose to go back there to- night nor does Doherty. No, not for the General himself would I go out. Doherty travels the relay to Post 1. I say some very fervent prayers for it seems to me that the farm will be entirely destroyed before morning. Prayers are a great relief to the mind. I can think now. I wonder why it is that we are kept here to be gradually killed off or sent to the hospital with bad wounds, without a chance to fight for our lives. The shell is cowardly. We cannot combat it. They come too fast to dodge and all that is left is to wait for death. I would not care if it came were it not for my loved ones. Because I have them, I trust in God to save me. I would be glad to fight, face to face with an enemy the sight of whom would give me courage. Strange to say, I do not regret or think seemly about the trip home, which I nearly was rewarded with. I would like to come home with tales of to-day and to- morrow and how the Lord and Leah's love saw me safely through the inferno. Thinking these thoughts, shifting from courageous to fearsome, I doze off. Doherty comes back swearing to himself that the easy snap he has had will be over, but to me one place where there are shells is no worse than another. The gun duels increase in intensity, with no rest for us. We are tossed about with the racking of the earth and the booming. An aeroplane comes and drops a load of bombs into the other end of town, taking a large toll. Big caliber shells drop as close as 25 yds. from us. So close that they shock me badly. My mind is clear now but my nerves are all on edge and I cannot sleep a wink for an hour or more when fatigue 286again becomes imperative and puts me to sleep. Not long before gas shells come over. I hear the alarm and adjust my mask. Ordered off again in a few minutes. Lie awake and find myself listening once more to the battle in which men die without having had a chance to defend themselves. There is a great commotion directly at our door. Something heavy is being pulled by men. They sing out as they heave, like the longshoremen at home. I wonder what it is. It occurs to me that our immense naval guns are coming in under cover of the darkness to take their positions. It is a horse, which has been wounded so badly by a shell fragment that is has to be shot and is now being dragged over the wall of a razed house into the ditch to be off the road and to rot in the sun and breed a billion flies. After that the transport moves on and there is comparative quiet until another gas alarm is sounded. I do not mind that. I remark the guard only smells powder. Wait for a second warning. None comes. I fall asleep amid all the noise that follows and in spite of the shaking of the building. My eyes are bad from the effects of the gas, my throat is becoming sore, my legs are played out and stiff from the work they have done in the last hours. I know I will be sick in the morning. Another gas alarm. Shelling until day break.

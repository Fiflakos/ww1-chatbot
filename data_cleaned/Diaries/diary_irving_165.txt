Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 29 July 1918. Nationality: Australian Text: Mon. Jul. 29, 1918 Weather: Fair, Warm Health: Good Up at 7:00. This is "iron ration" day. There are no rations received and breakfast consists of apple sauce and coffee. I am too late to get any apples, so a cup of coffee must satisfy me. I intend to do a lot for myself to-day if I have no official duties. I wash and shave. It seems to me it would be a good idea to clean my gun, something I have not done in a month or more. Hang out my blankets to air. Police. The boys suggest to the Sergeant that we go to the 247delousing station this morning. It is not doubted for a moment that Griffiths will give his consent. The sergeant puts the proposition to him and of course he permits half of his men to go. I ask to be allowed to go today. I am on sergeant's list. While the party is forming, I write a little more of my letter to Leah. I take the paper with me and fill my pen, to take advantage of any opportunity I may have during the day to resume writing. I am hungry. Luckily I have money with which to buy something to eat in the town. Pleased to hear from Jerry that we will have the whole day off. We can visit the company, too, and perhaps I can get a pair of shoes or something else I need. We go off at 9, fully equipped. Take the open road going in straggling formation, because there is danger of being seen by OB or observers within the German lines. We are cautioned by men building gun emplacements not to go near them. We look for fruit on the way. Meet some company men manicuring the roads, with Del Duca in charge. In town a little after 10. The YMCA is sold out of sweets as usual. We resort to the Salvation Army. There I buy cakes and raisins and Himpler buys nuts with which we fill the voids in our stomachs. We hang around on the square for a half hour, talking to men from the company, waiting for the delousing station to open at 11. We go to ........ where the station is located, eating nuts and raisins on the road. When we get there, man in charge tells us we cannot have a bath to-day, because of the shortage of coal with which to heat the water. After a great deal of red tape is unwound, we are allowed inside and promised a cold bath. Even that is welcome to me. We undress. I find many cooties in my shirt and drawers. The medical sergeant tells me that if I have lice I had better not bathe, because I will not receive new underwear. The proceedings are halted until an officer comes, who goes over the situation with the man in charge, and after a long time decides we can get a hot bath. We are all ready. The same thin streams of water as everywhere else, but it is most refreshing to let the water play on my body. It turns cold in a few minutes. Our bath finished, we go to put on the dirty, lousy underwear in which we came. When official red tape is unwound again and we are told we can get a new suit of underwear and socks, nothing more to be desired, but after the fashion of men who are given something, I want more. I ask for a pair of breeches and an OD shirt. I cannot procure any. We dress and I leave to go wherever I please for the rest of the day. Gillece and I go to E Company for our dinner. At the entrance to town, there is a plum tree, which gives a handful of juicy, ripe, sugar plums. We have a bottle of beer each in an estaminet. Time for dinner. At the company there is bully beef, bread, coffee, which with the fruit and cake we have had leaves us satisfied. Ask Bergen for what I need and get a fine pair of shoes and socks. Lt. McDougall calls me to ask a question. Barney and I wash our towels and go up on the hill over the town to get plums, after which I propose to finish Leah's letter. We are in luck and get many plums. Eat my fill, sit down under a tree to write. I am tired and propose to Gillece that he wake me up in a half hour if I fall asleep. He is writing and promises to wake me. I fall asleep and when I awake, Carney and Devaney are waking Gillece up from a nap. He does not know where he is and looks for me. I ask Carney how he feels and get full particulars about the accident in which he was injured. I write for a while longer and then propose that we go down to the village. There I write again until supper time. Some more men, who have not seen me since I have come back, greet me, among than Norman who lends me his mess kit to get my supper. In spite of the hard times, E Co. serves what I call a good meal. Bully beef, beans, tomato sauce, squash, coffee. 248Plenty for me. Rubin tells me of his experiences in the lines the night of July 3-4. He was with Devlin at post 20, when the barrage broke over his head. He says he has written 25 pages in his diary about it from which I judge how it affected him, because he does not write of trivial things. He wants to go to the YMCA to write. I am being interrupted frequently, so I think it best to go with him to stay for a half hour or so, while Gillece goes to pick more plums. He comes back in time. We are ready to go back to camp, when I find I have forgotten my towel. Go back for it and then we go for our billets. We take the open road going back, where from the left we hear the sound of a barrage going over, presumably in the sector occupied by the .......th or the ........th. Kept up steadily until we reach our barracks and late into the night. It is still light enough to write outside until I finish Leah's letter. Get a cup of hot sweet coffee from H Co. kitchen. Lie in bed to read and correct Leah's letter and then write by candlelight until the men complain about me and demand that I put it out. The boys have found a new form of bedtime diversion. They throw things around, heavy articles, soap, paper wads, etc. are thrown. I am afraid something will land where it is least expected and hurt someone. They also tell more stories when they are tired of throwing things about. A new thing occurs. Since I have been in this sector, I have never heard an aeroplane up over the lines at night. The men insist that all lights are put out, which is done as a precautionary measure. Then in the dark we can see that the woods are full of lights. In every barracks, there is the gleam of lights which makes an excellent target for Fritz. It is a Boche plane that is up. Nobody shells him, to my surprise. We are very much afraid that he will drop a few bombs in our midst, so the noise and joke telling is forgotten for a time. The plane hovers overhead for more than a half hour, then leaves again. Story telling and horseplay is resumed. In the early morning the barrage, which I heard, is attributed to the Germans. It still continues and when I fall asleep it has not diminished the least bit. After I come back from town a French soldier brings around some very good samples of hammered brass vases made from 75 shells. I would like to have some of them to send home, but I have learned that brass cannot be exported from French ports. No new light whatever on what our next move will be, when or where. Secrecy still enshrouds the orders. Some men's overcoats taken from them. Does that mean we are going to a clime so hot we will not need them? Our battalion, I hear, has turned in their rifles, which were packed in cosmoline. Learn at the company of new promotions. An imaginary gas alarm, which cannot be heard for the noise in the barracks. E Co. is feeding a company of engineers besides its own men. See only one of our officers all day. Learn a lot about farm produce, different kinds of grain, etc. See an old man threshing rye with a flail and investigate.

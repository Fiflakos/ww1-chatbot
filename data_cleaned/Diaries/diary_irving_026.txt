Author: Irving Greenwald. Date: 27 April 1918. Nationality: Australian. Text: Saturday April 27, 1918 Weather: Drizzle in morning, afternoon fine. Health: Good Up at 6:00. Reveille. Go up for breakfast, Bacon, bread, dates, coffee. 3rd platoon on police duty. Empty cans and swill barrels. Police and sweep roads. Prohibits me from shaving for inspection we anticipate. Orders are to roll packs for inspection. Grumbling loud and long. Looks like no holiday. Roll packs in field, when all set orders recalled. Rifles, belts, gas masks. Company formed for drill. Marched past prison camp as yesterday. Two men fall out footsore. I debate with myself whether I should. I can barely talk. No rests. Work on hand is skirmish drill by squads. Corporal Callahan vexed with everybody. We get him back to good humor sufficiently to prevail upon him to give us a rest. Lieut. comes up and orders us to work again. Callahan furious. Vents his spleen on us. Humour him again. Hell to pay now. Threatens to report all of us. Company assembled. Lectured about discipline. Back to billet again at 11. Given 20 minutes to reassemble with packs in field behind main quarters. Equipment spread on grass for inspection. As usual just the nearest glance in passing by Lieut. Angers us that we are put to so much trouble for nothing. Foot inspection ordered. We remove shoes, leggings, stockings. Asked if my feet are O.K. I te1l of strained tendons. No attention paid to me. Pack up. Everything wet and muddy. Sun comes out. Mess call sounds. Leave equipment in field until after mess. Beef stew, bread and coffee. Reassembled to get equipment. Dismissed for day. Take a short rest. My first opportunity to wash and shave. Get eggs and milk from Madam. Out to pump to tidy up. Do some washing, too. From the battle front comes again the boom of heavy artillery. Activity in the air renewed. They are at it hammer and tongs. No Saturday half holiday out there. It is rumored that our Major has gone to front to observe and that he has been wounded. He has not been seen for a few days. Hang wash to dry and air out our blankets. Chat with Reilly. Lie in grass and write until time for Mess. Bully beef, marmalade, chili sauce and coffee. Second and third helpings of beef. More to be had than I can eat. Arrange to take a stroll in the evening with Leonard and Eifert. Walk to village. Saloons are being closed by officers. Men are congregating in groups on the roads. In most cases a Tommy in the center of the circle telling of his experiences and bragging of the Britons accomplishments. I stop in front of the ancient church. Discover over the gate a plate reading 1763. I had no idea church was so old. Express desire to enter. Graveyards on each side full of queer tombstones, brass, iron, marble and some wooden glass enclosed boxes containing artificial wax flowers. Walk down a road at random. Run into a courtyard. Find a road leading to villages beyond. All on same plan as ours. What seems to be a castle is seen in the distance. We make that our objective. It is further away than it seemed. Darkness falls before we can reach it. Being afraid we will not be permitted to enter town if too late in returning, we wend our way back in the dusk. Stop in shop for some chocolate. It begins to rain again. Back at 9:00. Prepare to go to bed. Artillery is still very active. Firing seems more distant. Gossip has it we are to be absorbed into existing British organizations and used as needed. Prospect does not please us. We would much rather fight under our own Company. It is easily seen that we will have to undergo a course of training in British methods, remaining here for the purpose. Our officers and non-coms have been ordered to schools of instruction for a period of two weeks. When they return, we will be asked to learn a lot of new things and in some cases to unlearn old. In my walk I see acres of rolling farm country with patches of green and brown, usually a windmill at the crest of the hill or a row of tufted trees, or knobbed trunks which are ideal subjects for a painters brush. They invite the camera. If I could only have one to be able to send pictures to Leah of my surroundings or if I were permitted, to gather a nosegay of flowers to send her to let her know I am thinking of her and baby. A pond reminds me of a fishing excursion with her, a lane of our days of courtship. Tomorrow is Sunday and I will be alone. Not even a letter from home will I have to read.
